<h3>A DEDICATION</h3>

<p>In offering these little sketches of some of the interesting
events that have helped shape a career
now fairly familiar to the general public, it has
not been my intention to weary the indulgent
reader with a lengthy dissertation of literary pretension,
or tiresome data resulting from the obvious
and oft-recurring "I."</p>

<p>From out the storehouse of memory, impressions
crystallized into form without regard to
time or place, and it was more than a passing
pleasure to jot them down at haphazard; in the
quiet of my library, on the flying train, or again,
beneath the witchery of California skies, I scribbled
as the mood prompted, as I would converse
with an interested and congenial listener.</p>

<p>It is not, perhaps, a New England characteristic
to expand in affectionate eulogy for the satisfaction
of a curious public, but the threads of
these recollections are so closely interwoven with
maternal love and devotion, that this volume
would be incomplete without its rightful dedication
to</p>

<p class="c">MY MOTHER</p>

<h1 class="top15">GERALDINE FARRAR</h1>

<h2>THE STORY OF AN AMERICAN SINGER</h2>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h4>MY LIFE AS A CHILD</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">I</span> <span class="smcap">believe</span> that a benevolent Fate has had watch
over me. Some have called it luck; some have
spoken of the hard work and the many years of
study; others have cited my career as an instance
of American pluck and perseverance. But deep
down in my heart I feel much has been directed by
Fate. This God-sent gift of song was bestowed
upon me for some purpose, I know not what. It
may fail me to-morrow, to-night; at any moment
something may mar the delicate instrument, and
then all the perseverance, pluck, study, and luck in
the world will not restore it to me. If early in life
I dimly sensed this insecurity, yet always have I
gone onward and onward, eager for that which
Fate had in store for me, and accepting gladly those
rewards and opportunities which in the course of
my career have been popularly referred to as
"Farrar's luck."<a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a></p>

<p>Yet do not think that I waited in idleness to see
what Fate would bring. From the days of my
earliest recollection I have labored unceasingly to
attain the goal which I believed and hope Destiny
had marked out for me. My mother tells me that
before I was five I had already shown strong musical
tendencies. By the time I was ten I had visions
of studying abroad. At the age of twelve I had
heard the music of almost the entire grand opera
repertoire. By the time I was sixteen I was studying
in Paris.</p>

<p>My earliest memories take me back to my home
town, Melrose, Massachusetts, a small but very
attractive city not far from Boston. I can recall a
large room with an open fireplace and flames flashing
from a log fire into which I spent many hours
gazing, trying to conjure up strange and fanciful
shapes and figures. From the fireplace, so my
mother tells me, I would stroll to the great, old-fashioned
square piano in the corner, and, standing
on tiptoe, would strum upon the keys. I suppose
I was two or three years old at the time, yet it
seems to me that I was striving to give expression
musically to the strange shapes and figures suggested
by the fire and by my vivid imagination.</p>

<span class="caption">A LITTLE GIRL IN MELROSE</span>
</div>

<p>Hereditary influences must have helped to shape<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a>
my musical career. My mother and father both
sang in the First Universalist Church of Melrose.
Mother's father, Dennis Barnes, of Melrose, had
been a musician, and had organized a little orchestra
which played on special occasions. He gave
violin lessons and composed, and there is a tradition
that in his boyhood days he learned to play the
violin from an Italian fiddler, and afterward constructed
his own instrument, pulling hairs from the
tail of an old white horse to make the bow.</p>

<p>My father, Sydney D. Farrar, owned a store in
Melrose when I was born. In the summer time he
played baseball with a local amateur team with
such success that, when I was two years old, he was
engaged by the Philadelphia National League Baseball
Club as first baseman. He was a professional
ball-player with the Philadelphia team for several
years. Yet during the winters he was always in
Melrose, looking after business. Both he and my
mother were very fond of music, singing every week
in the church quartet and sometimes at concerts.</p>

<p>The house in which I was born is still standing,
a large, old-fashioned building on Mount Vernon
Street, Melrose, which my father rented from the
Houghton estate. It is next door to the Blake
house, a well-known local landmark. Most of my<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a>
early life was spent in this house, although subsequently
we moved twice to occupy other houses
in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>My mother says that I was a happy baby, crooning
and humming to myself, singing when other
babies usually cry. She says that the familiar airs
of the barrel organs, which were played in the
street every day, were all added to my repertoire in
due time, correct as to melody, although I was too
young to enunciate properly. My mother did not
think it out of the ordinary for her baby to be so
musically inclined, young as I was. I was her first
and only child.</p>

<p>When I was three years old I sang in my first
church concert. My childish voice rose up bravely;
and my mother distinctly remembers that I had
perfect self-possession and never showed the slightest
sign of stage fright. When my song was finished,
and the kind applause had subsided, I
stepped to the edge of the platform and spoke to
her down in the front row.</p>

<p>"Did I do it well, mamma?" I asked, not at all
disconcerted while every one laughed.</p>

<p>I cannot remember the time when I did not intend
to sing and act. As soon as I was a little older
it was decided that I should take piano lessons.<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a></p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 550px;">
<a href="images/ill_027_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_027_sml.jpg" width="550" height="360" alt="MR. AND MRS. SYDNEY D. FARRAR" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">MR. AND MRS. SYDNEY D. FARRAR</span>
</div>

<p>But at once I made strenuous objection to the
necessary restraint, an objection which in after
years manifested itself in much that I attempted.
I could not force myself to study according to rule
or tradition. I wanted to try out things my own
way, according to impulse, just when and how the
spirit within me moved. I could not drudge at
scales, and therefore found the lessons irksome.
I preferred to improvise upon the piano, and I had
a strange fondness for playing everything upon the
black keys.</p>

<p>"Why do you use only the black keys?" my
mother asked me once.</p>

<p>"Because the white keys seem like angels and
the black keys like devils, and I like devils best,"
I replied. It was the soft half-tones of the black
keys which fascinated me, and to this day I prefer
their sensuous harmony to that of the more brilliant
"angels."</p>

<p>My mother offered me a tricycle&mdash;one of those
weird three-wheeled vehicles in vogue at the time&mdash;if
I would learn my piano lessons according to
rule; but I had all too little patience and my father
gave me the tricycle anyhow, as well as a pony
later. These were some of my few amusements.
In fact, I cared little for child's play at any time in<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>
my early youth, and nothing for outdoor sports. I
spent most of my time with books and music, or
playing with animals.</p>

<p>Among my animal friends was a large Newfoundland
dog. One day my mother came into the back
yard and found me trying to make him act as a
horse, attached by a rough harness to an improvised
plough I had made of wood to dig up the
back garden. I loved dogs, and once my mother had
me photographed seated on a large painted wooden
dog.</p>

<p>Another childish amusement was to put fantastic
costumes on the cats and pretend that they were
actors or actresses. In time there were added to the
cats and dog a chameleon, a pair of small alligators,
guinea-pigs, rabbits, a bullfinch, and a robin with a
broken wing. I was passionately fond of flowers as
well, and my own small garden was a source of
pride and pleasure.</p>

<p>The world of make-believe was becoming very
real to me by this time. I dramatized everything. I
had the utmost confidence in my choice to become
a great singer, for at all times I was busy with
music, either alone or with my mother. It did not
occur to me that I could possibly fail in achieving
my object, and yet I was so sincere and felt so<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a>
impelled to try to "touch the stars" that I do not
believe it could be called conceit. Young as I was,
I felt that with my song I could soar to another
world and revel in poetry and music.<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>THE DRAMATIC IMPULSE</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">A</span><span class="smcap">t</span> five I was sent to school. Among my teachers
in the Grove Street School, Melrose, was Miss Alice
Swett, who remains a dear, good friend to this day.
She was ever kind and sympathetic to me, and I
always loved her, although I was often rebellious
and unmanageable. My own reckless nature, impatient
at restraint, could never endure the order
and confinement of the classroom.</p>

<p>The dynamic energy, which has suffered little
curb in the passing of years, was even then a characteristic
to be reckoned with; displays of lively
temper were not infrequent, but the method of
punishment at an isolated desk in view of the entire
class was far too enjoyable to serve as a correction
for my ebullient spirits and was abruptly discontinued.</p>

<p>Miss Swett was my teacher for several years.
While her affection and trust never wavered, I
doubt if she ever quite understood the harum-scarum
girl in her charge.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 550px;">
<a href="images/ill_033_lg.jpg">

<span class="caption">MISS FARRAR AND MRS. LONG, HER FIRST SINGING TEACHER</span>
</div>

<p>Only the other day, visiting me in my New York<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a>
home and commenting upon some unconventional
act of mine, she sighed and said: "Geraldine, where
are you going to end?"</p>

<p>"Well, I may brush the gallows in the wild flight
of my career," I replied laughingly, "but I'll never
be really hanged."</p>

<p>Those years at the Grove Street School, when I
was developing from childhood into young girlhood,
were full of excitement, romance, and expectations.
But I looked upon them as a trying period which
had to be endured before I could devote myself
entirely to my ambition. I was full of both temper
and temperament, and an unlimited supply of high
spirits which manifested themselves in various unusual
ways&mdash;singing and acting, idealizing myself
as many of the heroines whose gracious images
intoxicated my imagination. At times I walked on
air, and always my head was filled with dreams and
hopes of this marvelous career.</p>

<p>It was at this time that I wrote a play, "Rapunzel
of the Golden Hair," based upon an old fairy story.
As usual I wished always to be the heroine, yet
Fate had not bestowed the necessary golden locks
upon me. My dark hair was worn short, and I
must have looked much like an impish boy. Then,
my dramatic vision had soulful eyes and an angelic<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>
expression. But instead of looking like an angel I
was more like a gypsy at the distressing gosling
stage, too undeveloped; yet I dreamed of the times
when I would appear before immense audiences as
the beautiful heroine of my dreams and hold them
fascinated by my song and personality. I always
had the utmost faith in a certain power of magnetism;
it seemed as though from my youngest days
I felt that I could influence others, and often I experimented
just to see what effects I could produce.</p>

<p>The impulse to dramatize everything found an
opportunity, when I was about ten years old, in the
arrival in town of the brother of a girl friend. This
boy, slightly older than I, had been educated in
England and had brought back exquisite manners
and an English accent that greatly impressed the
young ladies of my class. I need hardly mention
the fact that these attributes were looked upon with
contempt by the masculine element, who had no
small measure of derision for the youthful Chesterfield.
I had cared little for and never encouraged
boy sweethearts, but this youngster's exclusive admiration
did arouse my interest. I felt flattered for
a short time. But alas! he was unmusical to a
degree, and companionship suddenly terminated,
on my side, when I found that he was to be<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a>
neither subjugated by my singing nor thrilled by
my acting.</p>

<p>One day I rebuffed him when he tried to walk
home with me after school, offering to carry my
books. Puzzled, he made a formal call on my
mother, doubtless with a view to a reconciliation,
and asked permission to accompany me as
usual.</p>

<p>My mother laughed and told him to ask me.</p>

<p>"I have asked Miss Geraldine," he said sadly;
"but she does not seem to care for my attentions."</p>

<p>A few days later he went skating, the ice broke,
and he was drowned. Instantly I became a widow.
Drama&mdash;real drama&mdash;had come into my life, and
with all the feeling of an instinctive actress I played
my rôle. I dressed in black; abandoned all gayeties;
went to and from school mopping my eyes
with a black-bordered handkerchief; and the other
boys and girls stood aside in silence as I passed,
leaving me alone with my grief.</p>

<p>For six weeks I played the tragedy; and then in
the twinkling of an eye the mood, in which I had
been genuinely serious, passed away. In life this
young boy had meant absolutely nothing to me; in
death he became a dramatic possibility which I
utilized unconsciously as an outlet for my emotion.<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>
I was not pretending; I was terribly in earnest. I
actually believed in my grief. Who can say that it
was "only acting"?</p>

<p>A temper, which I regret to confess time has not
very much chastened, came to the front in my
school days, to the dismay of my mother. In 1892,
when I was ten years old, the city of Melrose held
a carnival and celebration to commemorate the four-hundredth
anniversary of the discovery of America.
Floats were planned to represent the thirteen
original States. The selection of the school girl to
impersonate Massachusetts fell to my class in the
Grove Street School, and I was anxious for this
honor, not only because of the personal glory and
prominence, but because I really believed that I
could impersonate Massachusetts better than any
other girl in the class!</p>

<p>Well, I did appear as Massachusetts, and, with
the other "twelve States," was driven through the
streets of Melrose, mounted on the float, bearing
the flag of the nation. But two girls in the school,
who had voted against me in the election, watched
me from afar with swollen and blackened eyes; I
had struck them in a moment of quick anger because
their choice had been against me.</p>

<span class="caption">A YOUNG GIRL WITH A PHENOMENAL SOPRANO VOICE</span>
</div>

<p>The following winter, while many of the boys and<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>
girls were skating, a boy of twelve or thirteen,
named Clarence, annoyed me exceedingly by trying
to trip me with his hockey stick. I warned him
three times that he "had better let me alone," but
he persisted in his persecution. After the third time,
I skated to shore, picked up my umbrella, carefully
tore three of the steel ribs from it and, with these as
a whip, I thrashed Clarence. Clarence "sat" with
discomfort for some days, and I believe his mother
seriously contemplated making a police charge
against me for beating him.</p>

<p>This temper&mdash;or temperament&mdash;often found
expression at home in moods, when for hours,
sometimes days, I wouldn't break silence. If any
one interfered with or spoke to me during these
moments I felt just as though some one were combing
my nerves the wrong way with a fine, grating
comb. My mother was wise enough to leave me
alone in my intense irritability and depression. She
appreciated the extremes of my nature, which were
somewhat like the well-known little girl of our
childhood rhymes:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">"When she was good she was very, very good,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when she was bad she was horrid."</span></td></tr>
</table>

<p>I fear, at times, I was very, very horrid. But I
planned a danger signal! One day I came home with<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>
a pair of most distinctive black-and-white checked
stockings, the most hideous things one can imagine.</p>

<p>"Mother," I said, "when I wear these stockings
I want to be let alone."</p>

<p>Thus it was an understood thing that no one
should speak to me or notice me in the least while
these horrors adorned me. Perhaps after a few
hours, or a day, I would go up the back stairs,
change my stockings&mdash;and the sun would shine
again.</p>

<p>It was at this time that I was the victim of an
accident which resulted in a neat bit of surgery.
My mother and I were spending a summer in the
little village of Sandwich, New Hampshire. I was
crazy to carve a small horse out of wood, and went
down to the woodshed in the rear of the country
house where we were staying, armed with a hatchet
and followed by an admiring youngster from the
village. The hatchet was very sharp. My experience
in carving wooden horses was limited. Suddenly
the hatchet came down and clipped a tiny
bit off the extreme ends of my left thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>I screamed with agony and cried in amazement
as the poor little bleeding tips of my fingers fell<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>
to the floor, but the country boy, with wonderful
presence of mind, picked them up, and keeping
them warm in his closed hand, ran with me at full
speed to the nearest doctor. Fortunately, he happened
to be at home. When the village boy showed
him the wounded hand and the tiny bleeding bits of
finger, he clamped them instantly on the fingers
where they belonged, put on ointments, and bound
them tight with bandages. This marvelous surgery,
without a stitch being taken, actually was successful;
the fingers healed, and now only a slight scar
remains.</p>

<p>I regret to say that this physician, whose presence
of mind thus saved my fingers from being
permanently mutilated, is entirely unknown to me
now. Some few years ago, in Boston, I told this
story in an interview, and a physician wrote me
from some other city that he was the man who had
saved my fingers for me. I wrote and thanked him
for his kindness toward a little girl; but his letter
was mislaid and destroyed, so that even now I do
not know his name. Wherever he is, however, he
will always have my thanks and warmest admiration.</p>

<p>Finally, the time came for me to enter the Melrose
High School. I objected seriously to the<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a>
further routine of public schooling, as I wished to
study only music. But both my father and mother
insisted; so I began the study of languages. I was
intensely interested in mythology, history, and
literature, but I hated mathematics. I always preferred
to count on my fingers rather than to use my
brain for such merely mechanical feats as adding
or multiplying figures. In the study of languages I
soon found that my teachers were excellent grammarians,
but I pleaded that I wanted to learn to
talk and not merely to conjugate.</p>

<p>I took a supplementary course in literature, and
well remember the most important incident when
I competed for the prize. I was quite sure my
essay would win. In fancy I had already rehearsed
the pretty speech in which I should thank the committee
for the honor conferred on me. But the prize
went to some one else. My anger was sudden and
hot. Then and there I made up my mind that if
ever I could not be first in what I attempted, I
would drop it at once. I believed my material was
best and deserved the prize, and I was hurt at not
conquering before an admiring and enthusiastic
audience!</p>

<span class="caption">GROWING UP</span>
</div>

<p>Thus I early learned that maybe I could not
always win, could not always be first; that perseverance<a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a>
must aid natural talents; and that it is
cowardly to drop a thing when at first you
don't succeed. The sting of adverse criticism may
often prove the best of tonics! I have since found
it so.<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h4>I RESOLVE TO SING CARMEN</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">E</span><span class="smcap">ach</span> spring in Melrose there was a May Carnival.
One of the features of the carnival in 1894, when I
was twelve years old, was a pageant of famous
women impersonated by local talent. I was selected
to represent Jenny Lind and was told by the committee
that I must sing "Home, Sweet Home," but
with characteristic disregard for the expected tradition
I decided to sing an aria in Italian first. The
prima donna of my dreams would naturally dazzle
her hearers with a selection in some foreign tongue,
and then graciously respond to the clamorous multitude
with a simple ballad.</p>

<p>I had this stage effect quite planned in my mind.
I didn't know a word of Italian; but studied one
song by myself from "Faust"&mdash;Siebel's song
which Scalchi used to sing in the old days and one
seldom heard now. My Italian may have been incomprehensible
to a native, certainly it did not disconcert
Melrosians; my <i>aplomb</i> was richly rewarded
by numerous recalls, just as I had dared to hope,
and "Home, Sweet Home" was given with due<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a>
seriousness. I was happy and excited; I was "arriving"
at last! Also I wore my first low-neck dress.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this episode in the Melrose Town
Hall is made vivid in my memory by two notable
happenings. The first is&mdash;shades of vanity!&mdash;that
I wore a new pair of perfectly lovely shoes that
were too tight for me (but looked so nice); so, after
singing the encore, I was obliged to retire behind a
stout lady on the stage and take them off. When
the carnival was over, I found to my distress that I
could not get them on again, and I walked home in
my stocking feet!</p>

<p>The second episode of this day really marked a
turning point in my career. A friend who heard
me sing happened to be a pupil of Mrs. J. H. Long,
the best-known singing teacher in Boston at that
time, and this friend insisted that I must go into
Boston and sing for Mrs. Long. I was tremulous
with joy (still in my stocking feet), and my mother
and I&mdash;breathless&mdash;told my father the news that
arrangements were to be made for me to sing at last
before a real singing teacher!</p>

<p>My father eyed us and shook his head thoughtfully,
looking at my mother as though to say: "She's
encouraging the child in all this tomfoolery." For,
while he himself had a splendid natural voice and<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a>
loved music and was proud of my childish achievements,
I doubt if at that time he could foresee the
practical side of a musical career. But my mother
and I were heart and soul for the idea, and sing I
would and must.</p>

<p>Finally came the "day of days," and it poured.
Alas for the favorable impression I had hoped to
create! My hair had been tightly rolled in lead all
night to obtain the desired "crimps"; I hadn't
closed an eye from the discomfort and nervousness;
and here was the fateful hour at hand, with no
vestige of a "crimp," my face pale with excitement,
though I pinched my cheeks cruelly to make the
"roses" come, and my muslin frock out of the
question in such weather. I felt like a veritable
Cinderella in my plain, dark suit.</p>

<p>However, off we started, half an hour's ride on
the train. What I suffered in apprehension; how
dizzy I felt, and what a queer feeling I had in the
pit of my stomach! I could have wept from the
tension. Could this drooping young person be the
erstwhile very confident embryo prima donna?</p>

<p>Mrs. Long, of fond memory, put me at once at
my ease with her kindly manner. Her great brown
eyes looked into mine and inspired me with such
confidence that soon I was warbling as freely as if<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a>
I were at home alone. I no longer heeded the rain,
my appearance, or my surroundings. To my delight
I was accepted at once as a pupil, and it is to this
excellent and thorough teacher that I can give
thanks for proper guidance in my early years. My
aversion and distaste for the drudgery of scales and
routine manifested itself quickly, but Mrs. Long
knew the best arguments for my rebellious little
soul, and, as I really did wish to become a great
and noble singer, I worked as faithfully at my tasks
as I could.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I began to sing occasionally in the
Congregational Church in Melrose. My mother
from this time kept a scrapbook of newspaper
notices concerning me, for I was now beginning to
become known as a local celebrity. The first clipping
in my mother's scrapbook is from the "Melrose
Journal" of May 21, 1895, and is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Miss Geraldine Farrar, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
S. D. Farrar, has a voice of great power and richness.
Many who heard her for the first time, at the Vesper
service last Sunday afternoon, were greatly surprised.
She is only thirteen years of age, but has a future of
great promise, and it is believed that Melrose will
some day be proud of her attainments in the world of
music.</p></div>

<p>As a result of the church singing and the fact<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a>
that I was actually studying in Boston under the
famous Mrs. Long, I was invited to sing at my first
regular concert. The programme, carefully preserved
by my mother, shows that it was organized
by Miss Eudora F. Parkhurst in aid of the piano
fund for the Melrose Highlands Congregational
Vestry and that it took place on Wednesday evening,
January 15, 1896, in the Town Hall of Melrose.
I sang two numbers, "Non conosci il bel suol," from
"Mignon" (I note my Italian had improved), and
Auguste's "Bird on the Wing." Of this interesting
event, my first public appearance in concert, the
"Melrose Journal" of the next day said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Miss Eudora Parkhurst's concert in aid of the piano
fund of the Highland Congregational Church, given in
the Town Hall Wednesday evening, attracted a small
audience. Miss Parkhurst, who is a very young lady
and herself a musician of considerable ability, put a
great deal of work into the concert and its details, and
it is to be regretted that it could not have been better
patronized. Miss Geraldine Farrar was the leading
attraction, rendering her two solos with great confidence
and ability. For her first number she sang
"Non conosci il bel suol," from "Mignon," rendering
the difficult music with surprising ease and fidelity,
receiving a recall. Her second number, "Bird on the
Wing," was also well received. The Alpine Quartet, of
Woburn, Miss Cora Cummings, banjo soloist, Miss<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a>
Welma Cummings and Miss Parkhurst, violinists, and
Miss Bessie Adams, reciter, were the other attractions.
Mr. Grant Drake presided at the piano as accompanist.</p></div>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 550px;">
<a href="images/ill_053_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_053_sml.jpg" width="550" height="396" alt="THE GOOSE GIRL AND HER FLOCK" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">THE GOOSE GIRL AND HER FLOCK</span>
</div>

<p>I find in my personal notes of comment on this
interesting programme that I disliked the banjo as
an instrument, though Miss Cummings played well,
and that Mr. Drake, the pianist, was "very nice."
Even in those days I was given to analysis.</p>

<p>My success at this recital led directly to another
public appearance&mdash;February 5, 1896&mdash;in the
Y.M.C.A. Hall at Melrose, at a concert given
by Miss Jennie Mae Spencer, a Boston contralto,
through whose friendship and advice I had gone
to study with Mrs. Long. This was the first time
my name appeared in large type as one of the
principal singers, and I was greatly pleased.</p>

<p>This was the first paying professional appearance
I ever made; for singing one number and a duet
with Miss Spencer I received the magnificent sum
of ten dollars. But this concert called me to the
attention of the music critics of Boston, and the
critic of the "Boston Times" wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Miss Geraldine Farrar is a young girl who has a
phenomenal soprano voice and gives promise of becoming
a great singer.</p></div>

<p><a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a></p>

<p>My marginal criticism on this concert programme
shows that Mr. J. C. Bartlett, the tenor, was
"fine"; Miss Bell Temple, reader, was "good";
Mr. Wulf Fries, the 'cellist, was "elegant"; and
Mr. Drake, the pianist, was "nice," as usual.</p>

<p>These two concerts were followed by further
careful study under Mrs. Long, and then at last
came the eventful night when I made my real
début in Boston at the annual recital given by her
pupils. I shall never forget the date, Tuesday
evening, May 26, 1896. I was fourteen at the time,
having celebrated my birthday in February. The
recital took place in Association Hall, and I wore a
simple little white dress with green trimmings. On
the programme of this memorable event, carefully
pasted in a scrapbook by my mother, I find this
comment written in my own hand: "This is what
I made my début in, very calm and sedate, not the
least nervous."</p>

<p>Following my critical tendencies at the other
concerts, I find the programme of this first recital
filled with marginal comments. Most of my remarks
were very flattering to my fellow pupils.
Concerning Miss Leveroni, who afterward studied
abroad and returned to America to sing with
Henry Russell's grand opera company, I wrote:<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a>
"Very nice, gestures natural." Others were "pretty
good," "very fine," or "very nervous," and only
one pupil was criticized as "Bad, off key."</p>

<span class="caption">CALVÉ AS CARMEN</span>
</div>

<p>The Boston newspapers always gave extended
notices to the recitals of Mrs. Long's pupils, and
this was no exception. I was mentioned favorably,
but it remained for the dear old "Melrose Reporter"
to give me a most extraordinary and almost
prophetic criticism. I quote from the newspaper
clipping so carefully preserved by my mother:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Cavatina from "Il Barbiere," sung by Miss
Geraldine Farrar, will interest those in Melrose
who were not able to attend the recital. For many
months musical people have waited the gradual
development of this phenomenal voice, a God-given
power which the child has sent forth with
a freedom, compass, and quality that has demanded
the admiration of our best Boston critics. Notwithstanding
the florid and extreme difficulties of
the Cavatina, the execution and reserved force,
absolutely fresh and firm for each attack, was a
triumph and a revelation of tone power. She sang
without notes, and embraced the beautiful flowers
showered upon her, as unconscious of her success
as though she had stood among her mates and told
a simple story. With hopeful anticipation, her
many loving friends will follow her future which
seems already unfolding, and as the child glides to
womanhood, our little twinkling star may rise by<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a>
and by from dear Melrose, and become resplendent
in the musical firmament, where all the world will
love to listen and do her homage.</p></div>

<p>The first flowers sent to me at this recital, carefully
dried and pressed, are still one of my dearest
souvenirs; and I also treasure carefully the first
card of good wishes sent to me on that occasion.
It bears the carefully engraved name of "Mr. John
E. Pilling," and underneath is written: "May success
always attend you." I hope Mr. Pilling, if
he ever sees these lines, will accept the long-deferred
thanks of the little Melrose girl to whom
he sent such an encouraging message.</p>

<p>In my last year of study under Mrs. Long I
reveled for the first time in the joys of grand opera.
That winter in Boston, the Castle Square Opera
Company, an excellent organization managed by
Henry W. Savage, was presenting grand opera in
English at the old Castle Square Theater. The
leading singers were J. K. Murray and his wife,
Clara Lane. I became a subscriber to this excellent
company's performances on Wednesday matinées.
To me these matinées were meat and drink; all performances
were well supported by music-lovers in
the vicinity. It was Clara Lane whom I first heard
sing "Carmen," a rôle which has recently figured<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a>
so successfully in my own repertoire at the Metropolitan
in New York. During these enjoyable
weeks I heard this company sing most of the grand
opera repertoire, in English, and I was thrilled and
fascinated.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 407px;">
<a href="images/ill_061_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_061_sml.jpg" width="407" height="550" alt="JEAN DE RESZKE" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">JEAN DE RESZKE</span>
</div>

<p>Then came another great and unexpected joy.
The Maurice Grau Grand Opera Company, from
the Metropolitan Opera House in New York,
visited Boston for a spring season at Mechanics
Hall. My mother decided that I must hear Calvé
sing "Carmen." The cast included Jean de Reszke,
then at the height of his success; Emma Eames,
Saleza, Pol Plançon as the toreador, and of course
the wonderful Calvé. I completely lost my head
over this remarkable performance. For days and
nights I reveled in the memories of that magnificent
representation. This, then, was the visualization of
all my dreams of years. This triumph I had witnessed
was that toward which all my hopes, fears,
and prayers had been directed. This wonderful
creature was what I hoped&mdash;nay, intended&mdash;to
become. And then and there was born within me a
fervent and earnest decision that, come what may,
I too must some day sing "Carmen" with the most
wonderful cast of grand opera artists in the world,
at the Metropolitan in New York.<a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h4>MY FIRST DAYS IN MY DREAM WORLD</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">M</span><span class="smcap">y</span> meeting with Jean de Reszke is stamped vividly
in my memory, since he was the first personage
from that beautiful dream world of opera that it
was my privilege to meet. Music lovers of America
need no reminder of his tremendous vogue as a
man and his wonderful career as an artist. I had
the opportunity to sing for him through Jehangier
Cola, a Hindu professor who at the time was interesting
Boston society with his Oriental teachings.
Just how I met him I cannot recall, but he had personal
acquaintance with many of the artists, both
here and abroad; and so one rainy morning (dismal
weather always seemed to accompany such ventures)
my mother and I, escorted by Professor
Cola, descended at the Parker House where the
de Reszke brothers, Jean and Edouard, were stopping.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 424px;">
<a href="images/ill_065_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_065_sml.jpg" width="424" height="550" alt="EMMA THURSBY" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">EMMA THURSBY</span>
</div>

<p>I remember that I played my own accompaniment
and sang rather indifferently; the inspiring
"mood" was not to be commanded. Mr. de Reszke
listened politely, probably having been bored often<a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a>
by many such young aspirants, and gave me sensible
advice that could apply to the average girl
of intelligence and enthusiastic musical ambitions.
I recall that I listened attentively and seriously,
quite realizing that Mr. de Reszke could hardly
glean other than the most superficial of impressions
after hearing a stranger for half an hour, and then
hardly at her best.</p>

<p>Upon his advice to go to New York and consult
a teacher of whom he had heard excellent reports,
my mother and I made plans for such an immediate
change. My father listened in passive amazement,
but acquiesced, as he always has, in the belief that
whatever emotional tornado should overtake me,
my mother's steadying influence would maintain
the necessary equilibrium.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my excitement and curiosity
upon our arrival in New York. The first thing I
wanted to see was the Metropolitan Opera House.
The great yellow building at the corner of Broadway
and Thirty-ninth Street seemed to promise all
kinds of wonderful possibilities and the fulfillment
of my dreams. Little thrills of hope made my heart
sing and my spirits soar as I looked at the billboards
and whispered to myself: "Some day I <i>will</i>,
I <i>must</i>, sing there. My name shall adorn those walls<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a>
and spell enchantment to the passing crowd." I
walked on air, absorbed in the rosy future I was
planning so confidently for myself.</p>

<p>The teacher who had been recommended to me
for this visit to New York was dear old Louisa Cappiani,
bless her! She who had been the teacher of
many of the light-opera singers was greatly pleased
at my singing, and wanted me to sign a three years'
exclusive contract with her, but my mother decided
that I was too young to have my future controlled
in any way.</p>

<p>The arrival of hot weather drove us to the country;
so with great regret I said good-bye to Cappiani,
and we started for Greenacre, Maine, and it
was there that I met Miss Emma Thursby. She
occupied an enviable position in New York musical
circles and was recognized as an excellent authority
on voice. She was kind enough to say that she
would be glad to have me study with her when she
returned to New York, and so it happened that the
following autumn found us back there, and I commenced
my studies with her.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 417px;">
<a href="images/ill_069_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_069_sml.jpg" width="417" height="550" alt="MELBA AS MARGUERITE" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">MELBA AS MARGUERITE</span>
</div>

<p>That winter of 1897-98 was full of excitement and
thrills for me. In addition to my studies with Miss
Thursby I went to the opera and theaters as often
as I could afford it. And what a whirlwind of emotions<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a>
it was! Melba in "Faust," "Romeo and
Juliet," and "Lucia"; Calvé, the peerless "Carmen";
magnificent Lehmann (later to become my
revered teacher and dear friend); the incomparable
Jean de Reszke; handsome Pol Plançon; sprightly
Campanari in the "Barber"&mdash;memories crowd in
upon me!&mdash;not forgetting the versatile Bauermeister
of all rôles. I rarely had a seat, but was one
of the army of "standees," eager, enthusiastic,
oblivious to all save the dream world these wonderful
beings unfolded before me.</p>

<p>There was one upon whom I lavished all the ardor
of my youthful, heroine-worshiping years&mdash;our
own lovely Nordica, who became my ideal for
beauty, accomplishment, and perseverance. Later
I was to owe to her friendship and that of her husband,
Zoltan Döme, the valuable and timely advice
that diverted my path from a provincial theater in
Italy to the magnificent Royal Opera in Berlin, and
subsequent friendships that have proved so potent
as well as so spectacular a feature in my career.</p>

<p>Among the plays which I saw that winter were
"The Devil's Disciple," with Richard Mansfield
in the star rôle; Julia Marlowe in "The Countess
Valeska," and Ada Rehan in "The Country Girl"
and as Lady Teazle in "The School for Scandal"<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a>
(how I did love her as Lady Teazle!)&mdash;all wonderful
plays for a schoolgirl still in her teens.</p>

<p>It was at this time also that I first met Melba,
who was in New York, and it was Miss Thursby
who took me to sing for her. Much of my former
nervousness had worn away. I had worked hard
and was anxious for Melba's approval, and her impartial
judgment as to the advisability of immediate
study abroad. That day, too, the sun was radiant,
I was in excellent humor, and, all in all, everything
pointed toward a happy and favorable meeting.</p>

<p>I remember Melba's enthusiasm and generosity
with gratitude, though I have not seen her these
many years to tell her so. I sang unusually well, to
my own accompaniment, and she was so genuinely
interested as to propose that I should at once sing
for her manager, C. A. Ellis, of Boston, of whose
opera company, in association with Walter Damrosch,
she was the scintillating luminary. So a few
days later my mother and I joined her there at a
hotel which was the temporary home of the songbirds.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can picture my delight. I floated
in fairyland; to lunch and dine in the intoxicating
proximity of these wonderful people; to watch
them, like gods and goddesses, deign to descend to<a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a>
the earth of ordinary mortals&mdash;it was like living
in a dream.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 410px;">
<a href="images/ill_073_lg.jpg">

<span class="caption">MISS FARRAR AND HER MOTHER</span>
</div>

<p>The eventful day came when I finally sang for
Mr. Ellis. It was in the Boston Theater, and
Melba, Mr. Damrosch, and many others were present.
I was a little anxious at the idea of singing in
such a large, empty auditorium, and feared that my
voice would not be heard to advantage in such an
enormous place; yet, after the ordeal was over,
Madame Melba took me in her arms and embraced
me with enthusiasm and affection. She predicted
such splendid things as even I scarcely dared hope.
I was elated and grateful indeed at the general commendation,
for Mr. Ellis offered me an engagement,
and that night, at the hotel, Melba wished
me to sign a contract of several years to place myself
under her tutelage and appear later in opera
subject to her advice.</p>

<p>My dreams were fast becoming realities. But,
as usual, my mother's good sense dominated the
situation. While thoroughly appreciative of the
advantages that Melba could offer me in her generous
impulse, my mother felt that I was far too
young to restrict my actions and bind my future
career in any manner. Besides, with all the excitement
of the winter, my intense emotional nature<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a>
and the interest I had aroused in musical circles,
she wisely thought it best for me to be withdrawn
for a time from this all-too-stimulating atmosphere,
which might later prove unwholesome and detrimental
to serious study. In consequence, I was
placed in the household and under the guidance of
a dear friend, Mrs. Perkins, in Washington, District
of Columbia, to continue other studies in addition
to my singing, while I was impatiently waiting
to "grow up."</p>

<p>In the spring of 1898, when the war spirit spread
over the country like wildfire, my mother and I
were taken to the White House one pleasant afternoon
to call upon Mrs. McKinley. The President's
wife received us in the Blue Room, while Mr.
McKinley was occupied in his private office with
engrossing business connected with the war. Suddenly
the official news came of Dewey's great victory
at Manila. The President, with the official
dispatches in his hand, entered the room where his
devoted wife was surrounded by a sympathetic
group of friends. In turn we were each presented
to Mr. McKinley, and then, thrilled by the announcement
of the victory, Mrs. McKinley asked
me to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner."</p>

<p>There was a piano in the room, for Mrs. McKinley<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a>
was intensely devoted to music. I played my
own accompaniment, and, stirred by the glorious
news and inspired by the presence of the President
and his wife and the compliment of being asked to
sing the national anthem in the White House, I
sang with all the ardor and intensity of which my
nature was capable. I have sung "The Star-Spangled
Banner" many times since, but only once
under such inspiring circumstances, when, at that
dramatic moment after the tragedy of the Lusitania,
I called upon the crowded house at the Metropolitan
Opera (a benefit performance of "Carmen") to
join me in our national hymn. Garbed in Columbia's
robes, with two Red Cross nurses at my side,
the tableau awoke thunderous applause and the
great house joined in the singing with a will!<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a></p>

<h4>I REFUSE TO SING AT THE METROPOLITAN</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">T</span><span class="smcap">hrough</span> Miss Thursby I met Dr. Holbrook Curtis,
the eminent New York throat specialist, and
became his patient; his unfailing, kindly interest
and loyal friendship did much for me. One of the
amusing events of that early spring of 1898 was a
society puppet show which Dr. Curtis staged in
New York. There were tableaux and songs and
recitations, all for charity, and then came the puppet
show itself, in which I appeared as Calvé in a
"Carmen" costume.</p>

<p>Imagine a long stretch of painted canvas across
the stage, with the costumes painted grotesquely
beneath openings through which the performers'
heads appeared. Dr. Curtis himself assumed the
rôle of Maurice Grau, director of the Metropolitan,
and his make-up was splendid; various other amateurs
impersonated Melba, Jean de Reszke, and
other stars. The idea of the skit was to show the
trouble Mr. Grau had in managing his company of
stars. There was much amusing dialogue, and I
remember my complaint, as Calvé, was that I was<a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a>
asked to sing for nothing at all-too-many benefits.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 415px;">

<span class="caption">DR. HOLBROOK CURTIS</span>
</div>

<p>In Dr. Curtis's office I soon afterward met Mrs.
Grau, wife of the famous director, and she insisted
that I should sing for her husband. It was proposed
to stage a big special performance of "Mignon" at
the Metropolitan, with Melba as "Philine," and a
star cast, for the benefit of the families of the victims
of the Maine disaster, and Mrs. Grau thought
that should I please her husband he might consider
the occasion a propitious one to introduce me in
grand opera, as the rôle of "Mignon" was admirably
suited to my youth and vocal abilities. I had
studied "stage deportment" with Victor Capoul,
and knew the opera backward and forward in both
French and Italian.</p>

<p>I own I was greatly tempted, and eager to make
so auspicious a beginning. Such an offer to a sixteen-year-old
girl, I think, would be calculated to
twist any young woman's head awry. Fortunately,
upon reflection, good sense intervened and saved
me from what might have been a very unwise step.
Granted that I made a successful appearance, at
best it could be but the sensation of a few hours;
and I had no mind to be a singing Cinderella for
one night. When my triumph should come, if it<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a>
ever did, it must be the beginning of a well-defined
career, and I was far too young and ignorant to
tread this difficult and dazzling path so soon.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mrs. Grau made an appointment
for me to sing for her husband&mdash;privately, as I
thought. But when I appeared on the stage of the
Metropolitan, I found him surrounded by a great
many people, members of the Metropolitan Company,
business associates and advisers, and others.
What my emotions were when I passed in through
the stage door I cannot describe. Curiously enough,
this time the empty house did not intimidate, but
inspired me. Perhaps I felt the encouraging shadows
of the great ones hovering about me; at any
rate, I sang as I believe I had never sung before.
To every one's amazement I dismissed the accompanist
whose laborious efforts were more of a hindrance
than an aid to my "audition," and, seating
myself at the piano, I continued singing to my own
accompaniment, as was invariably my habit.</p>

<p>Mr. Grau was exceedingly pleased with the promise
I showed and especially predicted a brilliant
future in operatic singing; but he seconded my
mother's sensibly planned course for me to study
more quietly, less in public view, and wait till a
few years of hard work and experience had passed<a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a>
over my ambitious little head. As a kind afterthought
he added, no doubt to soften the sting of
my disappointment: "Would you like to sing in one
of our Sunday night concerts?"</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 412px;">
<a href="images/ill_083_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_083_sml.jpg" width="412" height="550" alt="MAURICE GRAU" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">MAURICE GRAU</span>
</div>

<p>"No, thank you, Mr. Grau," I replied. (No tame
concert appearances after my imagination had been
dazzled by a possible début in opera!)</p>

<p>"But it might be valuable to you to have your
name on the billboards of the Metropolitan Opera
House," he urged good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"You will see it there some day," I replied with
firm conviction.</p>

<p>He laughed, and certainly had no more reason to
take me more seriously than dozens of other young
"hopefuls" who dreamed of some day storming the
Metropolitan doors.</p>

<p>Quite without my knowledge or consent, various
reports of this and other incidents in regard to my
singing reached the newspapers, and I experienced
a distinct shock when I read in the New York
"Herald" the following amusing yet caustic criticism:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If half of what Miss Geraldine Farrar's enthusiastic
friends say of her vocal and dramatic talents is true,
then this sixteen-year-old girl from Boston is the
dramatic soprano for whom we have all been waiting
these many years. With all due respect to the young<a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a>
lady, a lot of rubbish has been circulated as to her
marvelous, not to say miraculous, vocal gifts and
accomplishments, and she cannot do better than include,
in the nightly prayers which all good girls say,
an earnest invocation to Heaven to preserve her from
her friends, that she may be saved from the results
of overpraise.</p>

<p>That Miss Farrar has a wonderful gift of song has
been attested by so many discreet judges that it is
doubtless true. But when alleged admirers of the
young singer tack on all sorts of trimmings, such as
that Madame Melba wept with joy upon hearing her,
and that Madame Nordica said, "This is the voice
of which I have dreamed," and that Miss Emma
Thursby refused to be comforted until Miss Farrar
consented to come and live with her, it is about time
to add, "and then she woke up."</p>

<p>Why not confine the stories to simple facts; that she
has a remarkable voice, almost phenomenal in one of
her age, which is true; that her concert successes have
been extraordinary; and that, if youthful evidences
hold good, she will some day assume an enviable position
in grand opera? Isn't that quite enough praise
without subjecting Melba to tears, disturbing Nordica's
dreams, or suggesting the impossibility of
comforting Miss Thursby? Miss Farrar is a handsome,
gifted, and very earnest young girl, and if she
has common sense as well as native talent, she will
say that little nightly prayer, turn a deaf ear to the
adulation of foolish friends, and attend strictly to
practicing her scales. Then some day, perhaps very
soon, this Boston girl will be electrifying metropolitan<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a>
audiences as Mlle. Farrarini, the latest operatic
comet.</p></div>

<p>I was almost in tears when I read this article,
tempered with kindness as it was, for the stories
about Melba and Nordica had been the results of
the feverish imagination of newspaper reporters
who had exaggerated the truth. But the musical
critic of the "Herald," who penned this prophetic
and caustic comment, really did me a great service&mdash;and
I thank him&mdash;for from that moment I determined
upon a policy of seclusion and self-effacement;
my pursuit for glory should be conducted
along the lines of modesty and restraint.</p>

<p>Alas for the miscarriage of such good intentions!
Seclusion and self-effacement have hardly been synonymous
with my euphonious name!<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a></p>

<h4>PARIS</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> time was now rapidly approaching which was
to be the turning point of my career&mdash;a trip to
Europe. Up to this time I had accomplished practically
all that I could hope for in America. I had
studied under the best teachers in Boston and in
New York. I knew much of the grand opera repertoire.
I had sung in concerts and recitals. I had
just turned seventeen. The necessary training for a
grand-opera career was then impossible in America,
and tradition decreed that foreign singers with a
foreign reputation should be engaged for grand
opera's holy of holies, the shining exception being
our own American Nordica, then in her prime.
I decided that Paris must be the next stepping-stone;
but how?</p>

<p>To study in Paris meant a great deal of money,
and my father's business in Melrose, while prosperous
enough for our home needs, could not meet
the strain of an expensive stay abroad. It was an
understood thing that when I did go, my father
and mother should accompany me. The financial
<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a>problem, however, seemed almost an insurmountable
one.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 363px;">
<a href="images/ill_089_lg.jpg">

</div>

<p>But once more the element of luck&mdash;or Fate&mdash;intervened
just at the most critical moment. At
one of the receptions given by Miss Thursby, at her
home in Gramercy Park, I had met a Mrs. Kimball,
of Boston. She heard me sing, and was interested
in the story of my ambition to study abroad. I told
her, however, that although my father was seriously
considering selling his business in Melrose, we
feared the proceeds would be insufficient for the
course of study that seemed necessary.</p>

<p>"I have a friend in Boston," said Mrs. Kimball,
"who is interested in music and perhaps she would
arrange something if you sang for her. Will you
come to Boston and meet her?"</p>

<p>Would I? The prospect was too alluring. A very
few days afterward I had returned to Boston with
my mother in response to a letter making an appointment
for me to meet Mrs. Bertram Webb.</p>

<p>Mrs. Webb was the widow of a former resident
of Salem. She was then stopping at her beautiful
home in Boston, and I sang for her. I was fortunate
enough to enlist her immediate sympathy and interest,
and, as I was a minor, the necessary business
formalities were concluded by my parents in<a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a>
my behalf. My father sold his store in Melrose and
realized a sum sufficient to reduce materially the
amount of the first loan we had from Mrs. Webb.
This sum, according to the terms of a written contract
drawn up by Mrs. Webb's lawyer and duly
signed by my father and mother as my legal guardians,
was to be an indefinite amount, advanced as
required, and to be repaid at an indefinite date
when my voice should be a source of steady income.
The only actual security given was that my life was
insured in Mrs. Webb's favor, so that in case of
my death she would be fully compensated for the
risk and loss she might sustain.</p>

<p>I am happy and proud to state that, although
Mrs. Webb generously advanced, all told, a sum
approximating thirty thousand dollars during the
first few years of my studies in Europe, every dollar
of it was repaid within two years after my return
to America.</p>

<p>Upon my mother's capable shoulders fell the
difficult and not always thankful task of financing
and planning for our adventurous expeditions.
Thus completely shielded from money worries
and material vexations, I abandoned myself to the
glory of dreams. I was ready to slave in passionate
devotion and enthusiasm to further the career that<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a>
meant my life&mdash;to conquer in song. And so unafraid,
and happy with the heart of youth, I set
forth to the Old World of my dreams and hopes!</p>

<p>We sailed from Boston late in September, 1899,
on the old Leyland liner Armenian. She was a cattle
boat; the passengers were merely incidental, the
beef was vital. It rained the day we sailed, and it
rained the day we arrived at Liverpool. London,
where I spent a brief ten days, remains only a vague
memory of fog and depression. I was happy to leave
it behind and continue toward the wonder city of
my dreams&mdash;Paris.</p>

<p>Who can ever forget the first intoxicating impression
of this queen of cities? The channel trip,
the bustle of arrival at Boulogne, the fussy little
foreign train tugging us unwillingly over the lovely
meadows&mdash;all I retain of that is a blur. But it
seems like yesterday that the spruce little conductor
poked his merry face into the compartment and
gurgled joyfully: "Par-ee!" Every nerve in my
body tingles now when I recall the excitement of
it all.</p>

<p>We drove first to a small family hotel which had
been recommended by some of our fellow passengers
on the Armenian. I at once took charge of
the party, and, in a halting harangue in French, told<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a>
the landlady what rooms we wanted and how much
we wished to pay.</p>

<p>"If you will only tell me in English," said the
landlady helplessly, speaking my native tongue
perfectly, "I can understand you better."</p>

<p>After this crushing rebuke to my French, I let my
mother arrange all details.</p>

<p>We remained but a few days here&mdash;only until we
could install ourselves in an apartment in the Latin
Quarter, very near the lovely gardens of the Luxembourg
and close to the omnibus stations. It cost
then three sous to ride on top of a bus&mdash;"<i>l'impérial</i>,"
as it is called&mdash;and six sous to ride inside.
By constant patronage of <i>l'impérial</i> during pleasant
weather, it was possible to lay aside enough for a
drive Sunday in the Bois. In those days there was
no taximeter system to disconcert, and if one found
an amiable <i>côcher</i> (and there have been many, bless
them!), it was quite within the reach of the modest
purse of a grand-opera aspirant thus to join the
gay throng of smart Parisian turnouts.</p>

<p>The first thing of importance was to search for
a good teacher. While I had letters to various
well-known instructors I never used them, preferring
to be judged on my merits. At last one day I
called upon Trabadello, the Spaniard who had<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a>
numbered among his pupils Sybil Sanderson and
Emma Eames. I studied with Trabadello from
October, 1899, until the spring of 1900; and, to
dispose of unauthorized assertions, I may add that
Trabadello is the only vocal teacher I had in Paris.</p>

</div>

<p>I also had a course of <i>mise-en-scène</i>, or preparation
for the stage, with an excellent teacher, Madame
Martini, an artist of repute and an excellent
instructor in the traditional sense of the word.
For instance, Madame would say: "After ten bars,
lift the right hand; two more, then point it at the
villain; walk slowly toward the hero; raise your
eyes at the twentieth bar toward heaven; and conclude
your aria with a sweeping gesture of denial,
sinking gently to the floor."</p>

<p>Alas, my progress was not brilliant along such
lines. I could not study grimaces in the mirror; I
could not walk hours following a silly chalk line,
and I refused to repeat one gesture a hundred times
at the same phrase or bar of music. Discussion and
argument were very frequent&mdash;also tears. Nevertheless,
I did learn much from so well-grounded a
teacher, and often have occasion to think pleasantly
of her first lessons with my rather difficult nature.</p>

<p>In the spring I heard that Nordica was in Paris
with her husband, Mr. Zoltan Döme. I was in a<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a>
fever of anxiety to see her, and have her hear me
sing since studying abroad. But how could I find
her? By chance I heard that she drove daily in the
Bois; so I persuaded a friend who had a very elegant
equipage to invite me of an afternoon to drive, so
that by some happy chance I might speak to Nordica.</p>

<p>Around my neck I wore a talisman which I had
worn for many years&mdash;a little silver locket for
which I had paid two dollars in Melrose when I
was a schoolgirl. At that time my cash allowance
for pin money was twenty-five cents a week. One
day I saw this locket in a jewelry store window. I
said nothing, but saved enough to buy the simple
trinket, which I wore as a talisman, with Nordica's
picture in it. Naturally, therefore, I wore this in
the hope that it would bring me luck in my search
for her, and soon to my joy I saw the famous singer
approaching in her open carriage, with Mr. Döme.
Of course, she did not recognize me, but as she
drove by I stood up and threw the precious locket
into her lap to attract her attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Döme picked it up, and to Nordica's amazement
she recognized her own picture. While her
carriage turned around, I waited on the path, and
soon my idol was actually allowing me to talk with<a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a>
her and renewing once more the interest she had
shown while I was in New York.</p>

<p>She invited me to come and sing for her in her
beautiful home in the Bois, and, when we parted,
she handed back my precious talisman. "Don't
throw it away again," she said with a smile.</p>

<p>"But it has brought me such good luck!" I replied
happily.</p>

<p>Next day, and many times thereafter, I visited
Madame Nordica, and both she and Mr. Döme
were genuinely interested in my vocal welfare. The
question of my future was discussed, and, contrary
to the idea I had of going to Italy and following
the usual procedure of enlisting in a provincial
theater there for experience, Mr. Döme suggested
my studying with a Russian-Italian, Graziani, in
Berlin, whose book upon vocal study he had recently
received and found unusual and beneficial.</p>

<p>I was not at all keen upon abandoning Italy for
Germany, but Madame Nordica's advice was paramount,
and, armed with some nice letters from her
to various friends whom she had learned to know
during her triumphs in Bayreuth, we made plans
to break up our Paris home.<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a></p>

<h4>GERMANY: THE TURNING-POINT</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">I</span> <span class="smcap">spent</span> that summer of 1900 uneventfully in Brittany,
and in the early autumn off we started for
Berlin.</p>

<p>This was another turning-point in my career.
The German capital was to further as dazzling a
future as my heart could have dreamed&mdash;and with
it were to come Romance, Fame and Wealth under
the shadow of the Prussian eagle's wing.</p>

<p>One of my letters from Nordica was to Frau von
Rath, the charming wife of Herr Adolph von Rath,
the leading banker of Berlin. Frau von Rath maintained
one of the most beautiful homes in the German
capital, and her social functions were attended
by leading dignitaries and officials of the Court.
It was no small honor, therefore, to have the <i>entrée</i>
to her receptions and to have her take an interest
in the little American girl who had come to Berlin
to study music.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 550px;">
<a href="images/ill_101_lg.jpg">

<span class="caption">&quot;I SPENT THE SUMMER IN BRITTANY&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Graziani proved to be a protégé of Frau von
Rath, and through her I met this strange and wonderfully
gifted man, whose early death cut short a<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a>
brilliant career. He proved a remarkable teacher,
and I profited by his admirable instruction throughout
that first winter in Berlin.</p>

<p>One day, in the spring of 1901, Frau von Rath
asked me if I could sing in German.</p>

<p>"No, unfortunately only in French and Italian,"
I replied. "I came to Berlin to study, but I never
expect to sing in opera here."</p>

<p>"Would you like to sing for the Intendant of the
Royal Opera?" she asked.</p>

<p>The Intendant of the Royal Opera in Berlin is
the personal representative of the Kaiser. He has
the private ear of the sovereign, and is supposed
to carry out his wishes in the conduct of the Royal
Opera. To please him, therefore, would be a very
great and unusual triumph.</p>

<p>Would I like to sing for him? It is easy to imagine
my reply.</p>

<p>I made my preparations accordingly. With the
care which I have always bestowed upon my costumes,
I ordered an elaborate blue crêpe-de-Chine
evening gown, to be worn with pearls and diamonds.
I carefully studied anew the waltz song
from "Juliet," the aria from "Traviata," and the
bird song from "Pagliacci." Suddenly, to my consternation,
Frau von Rath notified me that the<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a>
audience, which was to be in her ballroom, would
have to be held in the afternoon instead of the
evening, as some occasion at the Palace necessitated
the presence of the Intendant there at night.</p>

<p>I was desolate; but I agreed to sing, first begging
Frau von Rath to draw the heavy curtains and turn
on all the lights, as though for an evening function,
so that I could wear my evening gown with the
pearls and the diamonds. I can remember now the
suppressed murmurs of "The crazy American!"
when I appeared, but I obtained the compliment
of immediate attention and created the effect I
wished.</p>

<p>The Intendant of the Royal Opera at that time
was Count von Hochberg, a charming, courteous
gentleman, who was to show me many favors afterward.
He heard me through, attended by a score
of Frau von Rath's friends, and then asked me
gravely if I had ever sung with an orchestra. I
answered truthfully: "No."</p>

<p>"Would you like to sing with the orchestra of the
Royal Opera?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I should be delighted," was my prompt response.</p>

<p>"Do you sing in German?"</p>

<p>"I never have&mdash;yet," I replied.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 550px;">

<span class="caption">THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE, BERLIN</span>
</div>

<p><a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a>"Could you learn to sing in German in ten
days?" he urged.</p>

<p>"I can learn something. What shall it be?"</p>

<p>"Will you study 'Elsa's Dream'?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then in ten days, at the Royal Opera, I will
hear you again." He bowed and took his departure.</p>

<p>Feverishly I began to study German, aided by
my dear friend and teacher, Fräulein Wilcke, to
whose guidance these many years I owe as excellent
a German diction as any foreign or native artist
possesses.</p>

<p>When I stepped upon the stage of the great
empty Königliches Opernhaus and looked down
into the Director's seat, whom should I see but Dr.
Karl Muck, now the Director of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra. That was the beginning of a
warm friendship which has endured to this day, for
Dr. Muck was at all times kind and sympathetic
during those early days in Berlin.</p>

<p>I sang the waltz from "Romeo and Juliet," in
French, the bird song from "Pagliacci," in Italian,
and "Elsa's Dream," in German. I finished in absolute
silence, as Count von Hochberg was almost
alone in the darkened auditorium. Soon he came
back to me and said:&mdash;<a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a></p>

<p>"In my office I have a contract with you for three
years. Do you care to sign it?"</p>

<p>"But I had no idea of singing in Berlin," I protested.
"I want to sing Italian."</p>

<p>"If I let you sing here in Italian, will you sign it?"</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;in Berlin&mdash;sing in Italian?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"It will be a novelty," replied Count von Hochberg.
"But the people here want one. You are very
much of a novelty, quite different from the stout
ladies who waddle about protesting their operatic
fate to spectators who find it difficult to believe in
their cruel lot and youthful innocence. In you I
have discovered a happy combination of voice,
figure, personality, and&mdash;eyes." He was something
of a cavalier, that nice Count von Hochberg,
as you will see. "To secure you for my patrons I
will let you sing in Italian."</p>

<p>What could I say? It was the greatest compliment
yet paid me. I glanced around the Opernhaus,
hesitating. Then&mdash;I consented. The legal
contract for three years was signed by my mother
and father for me, as I was still under age. It was
agreed that I was to sing "Faust," "Traviata," and
"Pagliacci," three rôles, in Italian, but I was not
to be required to sing in German until I should
perfect myself in the language.<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a></p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 354px;">

</div>

<p>Then ensued a spring and summer of great preparations,
for my contract did not begin until the
following autumn. We went to Lake Constance,
Switzerland, to study with Graziani. I was as thin
as a young girl could well afford to be, yet I worked
to the full limit of my strength, for I realized that
my wonderful opportunity had at last arrived.
I literally floated on air that summer.</p>

<p>Then, too, I had planned a surprise that would
especially please the women: the matter of dress.
There lives in Paris an artist to her finger-tips in
the matter of creating stage frocks, and that wonderful
woman has made every costume from head
to feet that I have ever put on in the theater. She
had already "combined me" such lovely things as
made my heart thrill to appear in them!</p>

<p>The night of October 15, 1901, was my début at
the Royal Opera, Berlin. There was no advance
notice, no presswork. The bill bore the usual three
asterisks in this wise, as I was a "guest" and not a
member of the company:&mdash;</p>

<p class="nind">MARGUERITE. . . . . . . . . . . &#8258;</p>

<p>At the bottom of the programme, in small type,
the three asterisks were repeated, and the line:&mdash;</p>

<p class="nind">&#8258; <span class="sml">MISS GERALDINE FARRAR AUS NEW YORK</span></p>

<p><a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a></p>

<p>In the simplest of dainty blue crêpe-de-Chine
frocks, with a lace bonnet over blond curls, "Marguerite"
Farrar tripped engagingly down to the
footlights with a shy glance of inquiry to the ardent
"Faust" who commenced so successful a wooing
with "May I give you my arm?"&mdash;and everybody
felt at that moment how regretful "Marguerite"
Farrar was, that the exigencies of the opera did
not permit a courteous acceptance of so charming
a support to her gateway.</p>

<p>I remember that Dr. Muck conducted divinely;
that I was very happy and self-possessed, and my
mother said I looked like an angel. I had at last
made my début.</p>

<p>The following morning the criticisms were so
splendid that I told my mother I would never get
any more to equal them&mdash;and I did not for a long
time. Instantly after my success the hammers
came out. The idea of letting an American girl sing
in Italian in the sacred Royal Opera House&mdash;it
was preposterous! Count von Hochberg was mildly
censured by the press for permitting such proceedings.
Nevertheless, the fact remained that I had
scored a success on my début; the audience had received
favorably a "Marguerite" who was neither
fat nor forty, and the newspaper critics had<a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a>
united in giving me a most enthusiastic verdict of
approval.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;MY THIRD SEASON OPENED IN TRAVIATA&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Naturally after such a success I expected to be
called upon again very soon, but many weeks
passed and still my name was not included in the
published casts given out from week to week. Finally
I determined to find out the reason for this
neglect, so I called on Count von Hochberg in his
private office at the opera.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Your Excellency," I remarked
pleasantly. "I have just looked over the billboards
and I don't see my name included in next week's
repertoire."</p>

<p>There was a moment of embarrassment, then I
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I merely wondered why I don't sing," adding,
"Of course, if Berlin doesn't want me I should like
to know it."</p>

<p>Count von Hochberg murmured something about
giving me an answer the next day, but I insisted I
must know that night.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, Fräulein," replied Count von
Hochberg positively. "Within ten days you will
sing here."</p>

<p>Fate was ever watchful over me, and soon I was
notified that "Traviata" was to be revived for me.<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a></p>

<p>What fun I had in composing the adorable rôle
of Camille. And then, too, I was all afire with memories
of the great Sarah as Marguerite Gauthier.
I had <i>heard</i> famous prima donnas in "Traviata,"
but few, other than the emotional Bellincioni, had
ever successfully <i>acted</i> the operatic heroine. I was
allowed to eliminate much of the stilted traditional
settings, and, with modern scenery and sumptuous
dressing, I played this rôle so that it immediately
became one of my most popular successes. In the
romantic and handsome Franz Naval I had an
inspiring partner. Our artistic connection was to
endure many years, and we have left behind us, I
can truthfully say, very beautiful memories in the
hearts of our loyal German public. I particularly
recall our joint successes in "Romeo," "Mignon,"
"Manon," "Faust," "The Black Domino," and
such poetic operas.</p>

<p>By this time rumors of the "crazy American"
had spread over Berlin, together with reports that
she was young, slender and, some said, beautiful.
And then there were&mdash;eyes! The result was a notable
increase in attendance of smart young officers
and Court society. The Intendant arranged
matters so that I sang quite frequently during the
rest of my first season.<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h4>IMPERIAL ENCOURAGEMENT</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> was not until my second season at the Royal
Opera that I saw or met the Kaiser. The Court had
been in half-mourning during my first season, and
members of the royal family had not visited the
opera house. In January, 1903, the middle of my
second season, a Hofmarshal from the Palace presented
himself at our apartment and officially
"commanded" my presence at the Palace that
night. I was notified that I must wear the prescribed
Court dress, either lavender or black, with
gloves and no jewelry.</p>

<p>The Hofmarshal, having delivered his message,
was about to depart when I called him back.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," I said meekly, "but I never
wear black and I never wear lavender. Neither
color is becoming to me."</p>

<p>"But it is the custom of the Court&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"It is my custom," I replied firmly, "to wear
what I choose when I sing, and according to my
mood; and I choose to wear white. Furthermore
I never wear gloves while singing."<a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a></p>

<p>The Hofmarshal was greatly disturbed. He was
afraid it would be impossible for me to be received
at the Palace unless I conformed to the usual requirements.
However, he would see; I would be
notified. And later that afternoon came the message
that "Miss Farrar could wear whatever she
desired, but she must come." I wore white.</p>

<p>My mother and I drove to the Palace together;
we were formally received by various flunkies and
under-attachés, and finally escorted up the magnificent
staircase to the reception room just off the
White Hall, where the Kaiser and the Kaiserin were
with the Diplomatic Corps after dinner.</p>

<p>At the proper moment I was announced. After
I had sung, and had responded to an encore, the
Kaiser arose from his place and congratulated me.
He then turned and shook hands with my mother,
after which we were led to the Kaiserin and formally
presented to her. In turn we were made
acquainted with the various notables present.</p>

<span class="caption">MISS FARRAR AT FRAU VON RATH&#39;S</span>
</div>

<p>That meeting was the forerunner of many pleasant
social gatherings at the Palace, when mother
and I were honored guests. His Majesty was exceedingly
kind to us, and seemed to like to hear me
sing. It was on the occasion of one of these visits
to the Palace that I met the Crown Prince for the<a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a>
first time. He had been away at school at Bonn,
and came in one evening with several of his brothers.
I was naturally interested in the personality
of the heir to the throne, and spoke to him at some
length. I liked him at once, and found him very gay
and sympathetic.</p>

<p>One night at the opera he sat in the royal box,
and between the acts, so I was told, wished to come
behind the scenes to speak to me. The rule against
visitors is rigidly enforced at the Royal Opera, and
His Highness was so informed. He thereupon returned
to the royal box. After the performance he
again made an effort to call behind the scenes, but
was not permitted. However, later that same evening,
he sent me a hastily scribbled message written
upon a card showing the Palace gardens, reading:</p>

<p class="top5">You played very well to-night.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wilhelm.</span></p>

<p class="top5">I still have the card.</p>

<p>About this time I first met Madame Lilli Lehmann,
to whose far-reaching influence I attribute
much of the success which has come to me. I felt
the need of the careful instruction of a master. Of
course, the idol of music-loving Germany was then,
as now, Lilli Lehmann. I wrote to her, asking if I
could sing for her with the idea of becoming her<a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a>
pupil. There was no answer. Lilli, with her extensive
correspondence and active life, was probably
too busy to consider such a matter as a new
pupil. Then my mother wrote. In reply came a
very concise and businesslike communication. Yes,
Lilli had received the letter from me, but, owing
to my eccentric handwriting, had been unable to
decipher it. My mother's penmanship was clearer,
and so Lilli wrote that she would be willing to hear
me sing, without promising to accept me as her
pupil, however.</p>

<p>An appointment was made for us to call at half-past
nine o'clock in the morning at her home in
Grunewald, half an hour's ride from Berlin, and,
though the day was cold and wintry, my mother
and I were there promptly on time.</p>

<p>Beautiful Lilli Lehmann&mdash;stately and serene as
a queen; with a wonderful personality which seemed
naturally to dominate every presence in the room;
past the meridian of life yet with an unbroken record
of world achievement behind her; greatest living
exponent of Mozart, of Brahms, of Liszt, of
Wagner&mdash;what more can I say of her than that
I approached her with the deference and respect
which were her due? I was an eager and humble
beginner; she of another generation. My desire<a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a>
to secure her as my instructor seemed almost presumptuous;
yet, after hearing me sing, Lilli kindly
consented to take me, and I am happy and proud
to state that I have been her pupil at all times
since that first meeting.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 401px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;BEAUTIFUL LILLI LEHMANN, STATELY AND SERENE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Lilli insisted that I should essay one Wagnerian
rôle. Under her direction I studied Elizabeth in
"Tannhäuser," and the night I made my first appearance
in this rôle in Berlin was a memorable
occasion for both of us. The entire royal family
was present, and Lilli sat in a loge with my mother.
I should explain that Lilli, who had been a
notable member of the Royal Opera for many
years prior to her American successes, had had
differences with the direction of the Royal Opera
during the years of her tremendous popularity in
America, and had followed her own sweet will by remaining
here several seasons without receiving the
necessary permission from the Intendant to do so.</p>

<p>As a result, upon her return to Germany she had
not been summoned to resume her rôles at the
Royal Opera. This condition of affairs, I believe,
had existed for some time, Lilli, with the pride
and independence of a great artist, scorning to make
the first advances leading to her return.</p>

<p>On the night of my appearance as Elizabeth,<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a>
after I had scored a really great success, the Kaiser
summoned me to the royal box to congratulate me.
He knew that I had studied the rôle under Lilli's
direction. He therefore summoned Lilli as well,
complimented her upon her pupil's achievement
and then and there requested her to sing as guest
artist at the Royal Opera, which she did a few
weeks later.</p>

<p>It was a great and happy night for me, and I
believe for Lilli also.</p>

<p>Dimly connected with this period I remember
various young gentlemen showing me attentions.
There was a baron who mysteriously sent gifts concealed
in flowers, with very charming poems written
about the difficult rôles I was playing. It was
some time before I found out who he was and could
return his trinkets, with the request that he cease
sending presents to me. However, he continued to
write me pathetic letters for several years afterward.
But I was thrilled and enthusiastic over my
career, and had no serious thoughts for love-making
or matrimony. I wished to devote all my time and
energy to my work.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 370px;">

</div>

<p>But no artist can hope to escape permanently
the evil tongue and jealousy of those who envy
her the success she has won. Thus it happened that<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a>
the sudden interest in grand opera manifested by
the Crown Prince was made the baseless pretext of
a wild rumor of the romantic attachment of the
youthful heir for a certain American prima donna
singing at the Royal Opera. As I happened to be
the only prima donna to conform to the description,
I was the unconscious victim of many canards.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that the Crown Prince,
just out of college, fond of music at all times, was
enjoying his first season of opera. That I happened
to be the only young prima donna at the opera
house may be one reason why he attended every
time I sang, and ignored other performances. At
any rate, it annoyed the other singers greatly, but
it created no end of interest in my performances
and in no way disturbed my equanimity. I felt it
was all part of the career.</p>

<p>I was young, triumphant, happy in my singing,
and making rapid strides toward an international
reputation, and at the back of my brain was written,
with determination, the ultimate goal: the Metropolitan
Opera House at New York. So I pursued
my studies with zest and unabated enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Soon afterward I realized from vague storm-clouds
and distant mutterings that trouble was
brewing. Certain minor officials of the Royal<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>
Opera put their heads together with certain singers;
rumors that too much attention was paid to the
American singer by royalty were printed in one
of the papers; whereupon my father (remember he
was once a ball-player and is still a great athlete)
retaliated by a physical reminder to one editor that
such slanders are not circulated with impunity
about young American women. The press caught
the romance of the situation, and highly colored
stories were the result.</p>

<p>The climax of a series of petty annoyances came
one night when my mother was denied permission
to accompany me behind the scenes, as she had
been doing at every performance for almost two
years.</p>

<p>In my anger at these sensational reports, and at
the sudden discourtesy to my mother at the opera
house, I determined to write to the Kaiser a personal
letter of explanation. This letter was entrusted
to my devoted friend, Herr von Rath, to
be delivered by him personally to the Hofmarshal,
who would see that it reached the Kaiser.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 335px;">
<a href="images/ill_131_lg.jpg">

</div>

<p>Those well-wishers who had been freely predicting
that I would soon be requested to resign and
"go over the border" because of the rumors regarding
the Crown Prince (one newspaper even<a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a>
asserted that he wished to relinquish his right to
the succession to the throne in order to marry the
American singer!) were soon thrown into consternation
when one of the royal carriages stopped in
front of my door, to bring official notification from
the Kaiser that he had ordered restored to my
mother the privilege of accompanying me at any
time behind the scenes at the Royal Opera.</p>

<p>The envious tongues stopped wagging. Official
Berlin society took its cue. It was understood that
I was <i>not</i> to leave Germany.</p>

<p>I determined that since Berlin had been the city
first to take me to its heart, Berlin should be my
parent house. From there I might try to reach
out for other worlds to conquer, but Berlin should
be my base for an international career. And so
firmly did I adhere to this decision that, when my
first contract with the Royal Opera expired, I renewed
it again and again, with special permission
from His Majesty for my European and subsequent
American arrangements.<a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h4>ON TOUR: MONTE CARLO AND STOCKHOLM</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> discussing the plans for my third season at the
Berlin Opera, it had been decided that I should
create Massenet's "Manon." I determined to
meet Massenet, if possible, in order to get all possible
suggestions for the rôle. This was accomplished
through the Baroness de Hegermann-Lindencrone,
formerly Lillie Greenough, of Boston, who was the
wife of the Danish Ambassador to Berlin. I went to
Paris, and on May 26, 1903, I called on the composer
at his suburban home near the French capital,
where I found him in tears. It was the day
after the funeral of Sybil Sanderson, the American
singer who had won such success abroad, and Massenet
wept at the loss of such a delightful artist
and friend, who had created so many of his rôles.
Several days later, when he was more composed,
I saw him again. He was kind and sympathetic,
and I studied with him with enthusiasm. He was
most interested in the Berlin production, and quite
amused at the German translation of the French
text which Lilli and I had revised.</p>

<p><a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a></p>

<p>During this visit to Paris it was arranged that I
should sing for Gailhard, the Director of the Paris
Opera, and at this audience were three other notable
directors who were destined to figure in my
career. There was Maurice Grau, already relinquishing
the reins of management in New York,
but still hoping, he said, to take me back to
America as an operatic star in the near future;
there was Heinrich Conried, his successor, whom I
then met for the first time; and there was Raoul
Gunsberg, the Director of the Opera at Monte
Carlo. Gailhard offered me a flattering engagement
at the Paris Opera, but I explained that I was under
contract for at least one more year in Berlin. Gunsberg
was very enthusiastic in his praise; Conried
was quiet and formal. If I made any impression
on him, he gave no indication of it.</p>

<p>My third season in Berlin opened November 14,
1905, in "Traviata," when I had my usual charming
partner in Franz Naval. I now sang all of my
rôles in German save "Traviata," and, in deference
to me, all the company sang "Traviata" in Italian,
which I thought a pretty compliment.</p>

<p>The Berlin <i>première</i> of "Manon" took place on
December 1, 1903, and was a wild riot of enthusiasm,
but my best reward was a large photo of Lilli<a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a>
with half a yard of dedication written underneath.
By this time&mdash;the middle of my third season in
Berlin&mdash;I had become quite well known in certain
operatic circles; I had sung in Paris for four big
directors; I had won the real affection and regard
of the opera-goers of Berlin; I was now <i>Die Farrar
aus Berlin</i>, and the Berlin public owned me.</p>

<p>Herr Gunsberg, at Monte Carlo, always on the
lookout for novelty, decided he must have the
American prima donna who was attracting so much
attention in Berlin. One morning in midwinter I
received this characteristic telegram from him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Offer you début Bohème or Pagliacci. If you accept
this telegram serves as contract. Four thousand
francs a night.</p></div>

<p>Eight hundred dollars a night! It was indeed a
fine offer. I replied at once:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bohème. When shall I come?</p></div>

<p>I had visions already of international triumphs.
Monte Carlo, the show-place of the world! From
there it was only a step to the leading capitals of
Europe. Yet I had no wish to leave my beloved
Berlin permanently. Therefore, in renewing my
contract with the Intendant of the Berlin Opera (a
contract, by the way, which is still in force), it was<a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a>
stipulated that I was to sing so many performances
each season in Berlin unless excused by special
arrangement; that I should have leave of absence
whenever requested under certain conditions; but
that at all times I should be subject to the rules
and regulations of the Royal Opera in Berlin.</p>

</div>

<p>I remember discussing the subject with His Majesty
on one occasion when we were entertained at
the Palace prior to my departure. I had asked (and
received) permission for rather an unusual amount
of leave of absence, and the Intendant, who usually
conveyed such a request to His Majesty on my
behalf, said this time he really did not have the
courage to ask again so soon.</p>

<p>"Very well," said I laughingly, "I will ask him
myself, to spare you the embarrassment."</p>

<p>"But why should you wish to leave Berlin?"
inquired the Kaiser. "We are glad to have you
with us; we admire you; we love you. What more
can you gain elsewhere?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Your Majesty," I replied gayly.
"Already I have become accustomed as a spoiled
prima donna of luxurious habits to ride in automobiles,
and I don't wish to have to walk when I am
an old lady and when this" (touching my throat
significantly) "has ceased to interest the public.<a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a>
In the words of the great Napoleon, Your Majesty,
'Beyond the Alps lies Italy.' Yes, and there is a
white château by the sea where the golden shower
is just waiting to be coaxed into my pockets. May
I not then go and sing a little among the palms and
the flowers?"</p>

<p>I went.</p>

<p class="top5">Ah, that first rehearsal of "Bohème" in Monte
Carlo, in March, 1904! I was introduced for the
first time to a tenor of whom I had never heard
before. He was somewhat stout, not over-tall, but
with a wonderful voice and a winning smile. His
name was Enrico Caruso. It was his début in
Monte Carlo. He had sung in Milan, in South
America, and the preceding winter in New York.
But he had not then attained even a small part of
his present great fame.</p>

<p>At this first rehearsal in Monte Carlo an interested
listener was Jean de Reszke, who was kind
enough to say that he remembered me as the little
Boston girl who had sung for him some years previously,
and that he was delighted to see that I was
meeting with the success he had predicted.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 413px;">

<span class="caption">ENRICO CARUSO</span>
</div>

<p>My Monte Carlo début occurred on the night of
March 10, 1904. Although I had rehearsed with<a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a>
Caruso, the tenor had never used his voice fully at
the rehearsals, and on the night of the actual performance,
when I heard those rich and glorious
tones rise above the orchestra, I was literally
stricken dumb with amazement and admiration. I
forgot that I, too, was making a début, that I was
on the stage of the Opera House, until the conductor,
Vigna, rapped sharply with his baton to
bring me back to my senses. Then I put forth every
ounce of strength to match if possible that marvelous
voice singing opposite to me. I copy the
following extract <i>verbatim</i> from my diary of that
night:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Tremendous reception on my début. After the
third act, and in full view of the audience, Caruso
lifted me bodily and carried me to my dressing-room
in the general wave of enthusiasm.</p></div>

<p>The Monte Carlo engagement was limited, and
on March 28, I reappeared in Berlin, being received
so cordially that I then and there made up my mind
that I would never leave Berlin for good. The reports
of the Monte Carlo engagement led directly
to a most flattering offer from Stockholm, and on
May 6 I arrived in the Swedish capital. My mother,
of course, was with me on all my travels.</p>

<p>My début, which took place on the evening of<a name="page_074" id="page_074"></a>
May 9, was as Marguerite in "Faust." It was an
enthusiastic, sympathetic audience headed by the
venerable and adorable King Oscar. An incident
of the performance worth recording is that I sang
opposite to Herr Ödman, the tenor, who had sung
as a young man with Jenny Lind and Christine
Nilsson. He was then almost sixty years old, but
he gave a most interesting performance and was extremely
vain of his figure in "Romeo" and "Faust."
I must say he would put many a younger man
to shame in the costume of this romantic period,
withal being a sweet singer and excellent artist.</p>

<p>Two days after my début the Royal Intendant
of the Opera called to notify me that the King
would be glad to receive me at a special audience.
The royal carriage was sent to the hotel for us; my
mother and I drove first to the Palace in Stockholm,
and then, after we had been cordially received
by His Majesty, the King invited us to go
with him and inspect a beautiful suburban castle
just outside of Stockholm, which is one of the show-places
of the world. His Majesty had known and
admired Lilli Lehmann, and one reason for the personal
interest he took in me was because he knew I
was Lilli's pupil.</p>

<p>On the last night of the Stockholm season I sang<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a>
"Traviata" before a packed and enthusiastic house.
His Majesty was present as usual. He never missed
a performance while I sang in Stockholm. During
the performance the Intendant notified me that
His Majesty desired to receive me at the Palace
after the performance at a special audience. Wondering
and surprised, my mother and I drove to the
Palace in obedience to the royal command. We
were ushered into a small audience chamber, where
perhaps two dozen members of the Court were
already in waiting.</p>

<p>Presently His Majesty entered and, with a few
words, decorated me with the gold cross of the Order
of Merit, which he personally pinned upon my
gown. He explained at the time that only two
other singers had previously received this honor&mdash;Melba
and Nilsson.</p>

<p>After that there was a real Swedish celebration
of farewell which lasted until long past midnight&mdash;only,
as the nights were almost as bright as day
in that far northern country, it was difficult to tell
the time. I remember that after supper I suddenly
recalled that Caruso had written, asking me to secure
him a complete set of Swedish stamps, as he
was a postage-stamp fiend. When I told His Majesty
of this, the King sent out and secured a <a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a>complete
set of stamps, which I forwarded to Enrico
with the compliments of the King of Sweden.</p>

<p>As I was leaving and saying farewell, for we were
to go on the morrow, His Majesty said: "Next year,
Mademoiselle Farrar, you must sing again in Stockholm."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted, Your Majesty," I replied.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, you sing only in Berlin?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," I answered, "I have been offered a
reëngagement for Monte Carlo next March."</p>

<p>"Monte Carlo, eh?" And His Majesty laughed.
"My dear Mademoiselle Farrar, my physician has
been urging me to visit Monte Carlo. I shall time
my trip so that I shall be sure to hear you sing
there."</p>

<p>What a perfect darling old King Oscar was!<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a></p>

<h4>MY FOURTH SEASON</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> month of June found me in Paris, where I sang
at a charity concert, and in August I went to Bayreuth
for the first time and was greatly moved by
"Parsifal." On August 12 my diary says: "To-day
I placed a laurel wreath on the grave of Liszt."</p>

<p>In October, 1904, before the opening of the regular
season in Berlin, I went to fulfill a special engagement
in Warsaw. An incident characteristic
of the impetuous Poles occurred on the train, which
resulted in more than a year's annoyance of rather
an amusing character.</p>

<p>My mother and I were traveling in a private
compartment, with the door open on the main corridor
of the train. A tall, handsome, bearded gentleman
had passed that door no less than a dozen
times. Finally he passed just at the moment when
my mother wished the train porter to change
German gold into Russian money. The porter did
not have the change. Here was the chance of the
bearded man's lifetime. He projected himself into
the compartment, he made the change, he introduced<a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a>
himself gracefully, and calmly announced
that he knew me all the time as "<i>Die Farrar aus
Berlin</i>," the singer, and he wished to do everything
in his power to make us comfortable during our
stay in Warsaw. He turned out to be Count Ischki
P&mdash;&mdash;, a very wealthy nobleman with a most romantic
temperament and also with the persistence
of fly-paper.</p>

<p>We could not disengage ourselves from his courtesy
on the train, and he became doubly irksome
when he bombarded my apartments in the Hotel
Bristol,&mdash;the magnificent hostelry, by the way,
which Paderewski built and owns in Warsaw,&mdash;sending
me flowers, sweetmeats, candies, and even
attempting to send me jewelry. The poor Count
Ischki wanted me to look with favor upon his suit.
Never, outside the pages of a novel, have I met
any one quite so ardent, in so many languages.</p>

<p>The climax came one afternoon when I was reading
in my apartment.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door; it opened instantly,
and in came a procession of bell-boys&mdash;each
carrying flowers, enormous boxes of candy or
tributes of some kind. All these were carefully deposited
at my feet without a word. Then, as the boys
withdrew, the Count Ischki himself, faultlessly<a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a>
dressed, entered and threw himself upon his knees
before me in the midst of his offerings. It was a perfect
setting for the stage. I had all I could do to
keep serious as the Polish count poured out the
story of his mad love, and declared that, unless I
would marry him, he would quickly die the death of
a madman.</p>

<p>Gently I motioned for him to arise and depart.
"I fear I am only a cold, heartless, American girl,"
I replied. "I love only my art, and I shall never
marry anybody."</p>

<p>The night I left Warsaw the poor Count Ischki
was at the station to see me off, and, though I felt
sorry for him, I was happy at escaping from so
trying an emotional character. For almost a year,
however, he followed me over Europe, popping up
most unexpectedly at different places, always with a
renewed declaration of his love. His attentions at
Monte Carlo finally became so embarrassing that
I threatened to appeal to the police. Then he ultimately
accepted his <i>congé</i>, and I was relieved of this
all-too-ardent nobleman.</p>

<p>The season of 1904-05 in Berlin (my fourth season)
was made notable by the first appearance there
of Caruso, who made his début in "Rigoletto."
His coming created a great sensation. I was delighted<a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a>
to sing opposite him again, but there was
a complication of which the public knew nothing.
With the "king of tenors" singing on the stage with
me, I knew there was another&mdash;Franz Naval&mdash;who
had sung opposite me for three seasons, sitting
in a box in the background. However, I compromised
with the two by usually having tea with
Franz and dinner with Enrico during his stay in
Berlin, and the artistic world rolled smoothly on.</p>

<p>Many interesting things happened during my
fourth season in Berlin. For one thing the marriage
of the Crown Prince to the Grand Duchess Cécile
took place, thereby permanently putting an end
to the little annoyances to which his kindly admiration
of me as an artist had subjected me. I am
proud and happy to state that soon after the return
of the royal couple to the Palace at Potsdam, I was
invited to sing for the Crown Princess and, as
a result of this meeting, a cordial and friendly
intimacy sprang up between us, which often led
to informal musicales at the Palace when the
Crown Princess played the piano, the Crown Prince
the violin, and I sang.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;THE AMUSING MADAME SANS GÊNE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The spring of 1905 found me once more in Monte
Carlo, where a notable performance was the <i>première</i>
of Saint-Saëns' "L'Ancêtre," in which I created<a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a>
the rôle of Margarita. During this spring engagement
I created another rôle, the title part in Mascagni's
"Amica." Preparations for the opera had
been well under way for some time, Calvé having
been engaged for Amica. Five days before the
<i>première</i> she withdrew for reasons which were
never explained to me. Gunsberg appealed to me
as a favor to help him out, if possible, and create
this very difficult rôle. I agreed, and, by working
day and night, I succeeded in preparing it
in time for the performance. At this special performance
Gatti-Casazza, who was then Director
of La Scala at Milan, heard me sing for the first
time, but all he recalls, he says, were a pair of eyes
and a very tempestuous young person.</p>

<p>One night during this spring season in Monte
Carlo I caught sight of a familiar face in the recesses
of a stage box and, for the curtain call, I made
the royal salute to this box. After the curtain fell,
every one started to make fun of me.</p>

<p>"We have no royalty in Monte Carlo," one said.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I replied, "but I shall always give
the royal salute when King Oscar of Sweden is in
the audience."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, His Majesty, who had timed
his visit to Monte Carlo so that he could hear me<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a>
sing, as he said he would. The next morning I
read in the newspapers that the King of Sweden,
traveling incognito as Count Haga, was visiting
Monte Carlo as the guest of the Prince of Monaco.</p>

<p>In Monte Carlo even royalty mingles with the
crowd, and so it happened that later in the day I
encountered His Majesty strolling along in a smart
gray suit, with an Alpine hat and stick, looking for
all the world like some prosperous American banker
seeing Europe on a vacation. His Majesty was
kind enough to entertain both my mother and me
at dinner several times during this engagement in
Monte Carlo.</p>

<span class="caption">LA TOSCA</span>
</div>

<p>The fact that I created the title rôle in "Amica"
in five days was duly telegraphed to Paris and
other cities, and led directly to a most spectacular
engagement in the French capital, which must be
recorded as my Parisian début. A certain Count
Camondo, a wealthy patron of the arts who made
Paris his home, had written the music to an operatic
libretto by Victor Capoul, entitled "The Clown."
Count Camondo came to Monte Carlo, engaged the
entire Monte Carlo Opera Company&mdash;including
me, as I had special leave of absence from the
Kaiser for the occasion&mdash;at an exorbitant figure
to sing three performances of the new opera in Paris,<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a>
all proceeds to go to charity. Count Camondo paid
all expenses, staged the opera lavishly, and we sang
the three performances to crowded houses, at the
Théâtre Réjane, Paris. At last I had sung in grand
opera in Paris, even if only for charity!

<h4>LEAVING BERLIN</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">A</span><span class="smcap">fter</span> a short season in Stockholm, where once
more I had the pleasure of singing before dear old
King Oscar, I found myself in Berlin. One morning
my maid brought me this telephone message:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Heinrich Conried of New York is at the Hotel
Bristol. Will Miss Farrar please come down and
sing for him?</p></div>

<p>I promptly had the maid telephone carefully as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Miss Farrar is at her home, and, if Herr Conried
wishes to call, she will be glad to see him.</p></div>

<p>Later that same day Herr Conried called. He
was scouting Europe for artists for the Metropolitan,
and he had been advised by Maurice Grau to
keep a watchful eye upon my career.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 396px;">

<span class="caption">WOLF-FERRARI</span>
</div>

<p>We talked of his plans for New York, and Herr
Conried expressed a wish to have me return to my
native land. Of course, from the day I had first
dreamed of singing in grand opera, the Metropolitan
had been my ultimate goal, but now that the<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a>
moment for considering so important a step had
come I was very wary. Knowing that New York
was loyal to some of the older artists still under
contract, I wanted to protect my interests as best
I could while working up my career in America.
I do not believe that Mr. Conried was then very
anxious to have me come; certainly he was much
taken aback when I stated my ideas of the contract.
They were so entirely at divergence with his that
the interview came to nothing, and he departed.
I was neither glad nor sorry. I telegraphed Maurice
Grau the result, to which he laconically replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="top5">Don't worry, he'll be back.</p>

<p class="top5">Having been many years in that same position,
<i>vis-à-vis</i> prima donnas, Maurice Grau well knew
whereof he spoke, for indeed Mr. Conried did
"come back," finding me on my vacation in Franzensbad,
where I had been very busily concerned
looking up all manner of contracts for America.
After much obstinacy on my part and reiteration on
his, we managed to close the contract. Besides my
guaranteed operatic performances I was to sing in
no private houses unless agreeable to me and only
for special compensation; and I incorporated every
possible clause imaginable about dressing-rooms,<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a>
drawing-rooms on trains, carriages, railroad fares
for my mother and my maids on tour, and in fact
every conceivable concession which the most
arrogant prima donna might demand. Not that
I really cared about such items of expense, but I
was determined to enter the Metropolitan <i>en dignité</i>,
and I did.</p>

<p>The contract was not to take effect until a year
later, in November, 1906. Meanwhile, I was to
conclude another season in Berlin, fulfill all European
contracts in the spring, and then secure leave
of absence from the Kaiser for three years. It was
arranged, however, that I should always be subject
to the demands of the Royal Opera, and one of the
clauses of the Conried contract was that, if at any
time I was called back to appear in Berlin, my
contract would be indefinitely postponed until such
time as I could fulfill it without conflicting with my
Berlin contract.</p>

<span class="caption">LEAVING BERLIN</span>
</div>

<p>That concluding season in Berlin was a constant
series of farewells. The news had been made public
that I was to sing in America, and that I would be
absent for at least a year. One of the pleasant memories
of that season is a farewell concert at the
Marmor Palace at Potsdam for the Crown Prince
and Princess, when they presented to me a diamond<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a>
pendant made up of the letters "W-C" interwoven&mdash;Wilhelm
and Cécile. The Crown Princess Cécile,
gracious, charming, young, adored in Berlin and
throughout Germany, was greatly interested in
charities, and during my last season in Berlin I assisted
her in organizing the programmes for many
charity concerts.</p>

<p>At last came the eventful day when I was to
leave the country of my adoption for the land of
my nativity. I had announced an "Abschied," or
"Farewell Concert," in Philharmonic Hall, Berlin,
the first week in October, 1906. We charged five
dollars a seat, and could have sold the house twice
over. One half the gross receipts went to a hospital
kitchen founded by my dear Frau von Rath, who
had been so kind to me; and the other half went to
the fund of the Crown Princess's pet charity for
crippled children. It was a wonderful and representative
audience, in which royalty was conspicuously
present.</p>

<p>Next day we drove through crowds in the streets
of Berlin, <i>en route</i> to the station for Bremerhaven,
from which we sailed on the Kaiser Wilhelm II,
my mother, father, and I. Quite a contrast to our
last voyage together on the cattle ship from Boston!
But now we were homeward bound. I was<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a>
returning to the land of my birth after an absence
of nearly seven years, to sing in the greatest temple
of music in the western world. It represented the
near approach of the greatest of my dreams.</p>

<p>But, could I have foreseen all the difficulties that
were to come to me, I wonder if I would have been
so buoyant and care-free as the great ship pounded
her way westward through the October seas!<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h4>MY FIRST APPEARANCE IN NEW YORK</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> air was crisp and cold that brilliant November
morning when the Kaiser Wilhelm II nosed her way
into New York Harbor. How proud and alert I felt
as I looked up at the mass of towering buildings,
their pinnacles sharply tilted against the dazzling
blue of the sky. The harbor swarmed with seagoing
craft; all was excitement and interest, particularly
so when the revenue cutter and the mail boat were
shortly made fast alongside the big liner. The
kindly purser was soon pouring hundreds of letters
and telegrams into my eager hands, sweet and welcoming
messages&mdash;happy augury! All the world
seemed to smile on me that day. Not even the persistent
reporters could curb my enthusiasm or spoil
my high spirits. How we laughed and chatted, Mr.
Conried an amused spectator at my side.</p>

<p>An avalanche of questions, almost all pointedly
personal, were hurled at me, everybody talking at
once. The rôle of the modest violet was not to be
mine, I could see from the outset.... Yes, I loved
Berlin.... Yes, I had sung for the Emperor....<a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a>
Yes, the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess were
a charming couple.... Yes, I hoped to duplicate
my European successes in my own country....
No, I was not engaged.... Nor secretly married....
Why?... Well, because I just wasn't. And
so on&mdash;endlessly, it seemed. Pencils scribbled unceasingly
and cameras clicked at all possible angles.
I did not care for that, since I wore a most fetching
little turban and some beautiful furs (the pictures
wouldn't be unattractive). I was hardly
settled at my hotel when the editions of the papers
were being sold, and their readers learned from the
notices, profusely illustrated (the turban really did
come out well!), that "Geraldine Farrar had arrived."</p>

<p>Dazed and tired by the excitement of arrival
and the thousand-and-one greetings of welcoming
friends, I could think of but one thing, my début.
It pursued me by day and haunted my sleepless
nights. No one can imagine what anguish I endured
once I was alone, and how difficult it was to
discuss the event with an airy indifference to outsiders.
I told myself there was nothing to fear;
that my home people would love and support me as
had my loyal Berliners. If only the trying ordeal
were over!</p>

</div>

<p><a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a>To my disappointment "Romeo and Juliet" had
been chosen, not only for my début, but for the
opening performance of the season as well. In vain
I pleaded that, under such a strain I should acquit
myself much better in Elizabeth ("Tannhäuser"),
which I had just sung in Berlin and Munich with
great success. Mr. Conried was obdurate, however;
he said I must be presented in a spectacular production,
and so I had to give in.</p>

<p>I shall always remember my first rehearsal in the
dimly-lighted ladies' parlor. The suave and elegant
Pol Plançon (the Friar) and my friend, Josephine
Jacoby, greeted me, and then Rousselière, of Monte
Carlo days, who was making his début as well, as
my "Romeo." We were both frightfully nervous
and longed for the day to be over.</p>

<p>November 26, 1906, however, did finally arrive.
I drove to the opera and slipped into my gown&mdash;not
the usual conventional robe of stiff white satin,
but a heavenly concoction that my clever wizard
of a dressmaker had faithfully and beautifully
modeled after a Botticelli painting. A misty veiling
of rose delicately traced with silken flowers and
sprinkled with tiny diamonds sheathed my figure
of fortunate slenderness (thanks be!), while a jeweled
fillet of gold rested on my own dark hair, and a<a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a>
tiny curling feather waved alertly on my forehead.
And so "La Bella Simonetta" came to life, along
the Capulet halls, transported for the nonce to the
twentieth century and Broadway. A rain of welcoming
applause greeted me and told me that so
far all was well!</p>

<p>I cannot remember distinctly all that occurred
that auspicious evening. There seemed to be cart-loads
of flowers; and again and again I smiled out
from the great yellow curtains. Mr. Conried congratulated
me, and the great evening was over!</p>

<p>I was at home.</p>

<p>Now I was to drag out some uninspiring weeks in
such operas as "La Damnation de Faust," "Faust,"
and "Juliette," all of no particular interest to
me.</p>

<p>The real bright spot in the season was the first
production of "Madame Butterfly" on the 11th
of February, 1907. This charming opera was to
endear me later to all my audiences and firmly
establish me in the favor of the whole country.
However, at the time no such encouraging and
pleasing vision was vouchsafed me.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 411px;">
<a href="images/ill_177_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_177_sml.jpg" width="411" height="550" alt="&quot;ADORABLE, UNFORGETTABLE BLOSSOM OF JAPAN&quot;" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">&quot;ADORABLE, UNFORGETTABLE BLOSSOM OF JAPAN&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>I slaved with ardor and enthusiasm, studying
Oriental characteristics and gestures with a clever
little Japanese actress, Fu-ji-Ko, and incorporating<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a>
as much as was possible of her counsels in my
portrayal of the hapless "Cio-cio-San." <i>Maestros</i>
came and went, as did Mr. Ricordi, the publisher,
and Mr. Puccini. Everybody had a hand in the pie,
till I was nearly out of my mind with all the many
advisers. But I left nothing undone (that I could
imagine!) to make my rôle as perfect as possible.
Caruso and Scotti had already shared with Destinn
the success of the London production, so it remained
for Louise Homer and myself to make the most of
that charming second act, which is so poignant a
scene between the two women.</p>

<p>"Madame Butterfly" was a triumph for us all,
and for me in particular. There were flowers, laurel
wreaths (one with a darling little flag of Nippon
tucked away in the green leaves), thanks from author,
directors, and so on, embraces, applause,
excitement&mdash;all the usual hubbub of a successful
<i>première</i>.</p>

<p>Somehow I got home and sobbed myself to sleep
on my mother's shoulder, utterly worn out by the
nervous strain and cruel fatigue of the previous
weeks.</p>

<p>Ah! Adorable, unforgettable blossom of Japan!
Thanks to your gentle ways, that night I placed my
foot on the rung of the ladder that leads to the firmament<a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a>
of stars! When I don your silken draperies
and voice your sweet faith in the haunting melodies
that envelop you, then are all eyes dim and hearts
atune to your every appeal for sympathy!</p>

<p>"Butterfly" brought me in touch as well with
that past master of stagecraft, David Belasco. To
my great delight he was enthusiastic over my portrayal
of this little heroine who was the child of his
heart and brain in the drama.</p>

<p>I may own that every time we meet and he says,
half laughingly, half quizzically, "Well, when are
you going to forsake opera and come into the
drama?" I am almost tempted to make an experiment
of such interest, for the theater has always
made a strong appeal to my dramatic instincts.</p>

<p>Who knows? Some day may see me a candidate
for such honors if I take his invitation seriously!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was wondering just how my artistic
status was going to grow under conditions prevailing
in our opera house. My repertoire was extensive
in my contract, but limited on the actual billboards,
owing to a predominance of prima donnas.
Patience, with a big P, did not seem to help my
ambitions much.</p>

</div>

<p>Finally the company went on the annual spring
tour, and I have a confused remembrance of much<a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a>
traveling, new audiences and hard work. I loved
Chicago from the first, and its enthusiastic support
is always reliable, whether I visit there in opera or
in concert.</p>

<p>During the winter Gailhard had negotiated and
secured my services for a special spring season, so
that after the Metropolitan season I was to realize
another cherished ambition and appear in the regular
repertoire of the Paris Opera.</p>

<p>With these plans for the spring, Berlin in the
autumn, and New York all winter, I was running
perilously near the danger line of overwork. My
physician advised caution, less work and more absolute
rest, not to take my career so strenuously,
as even my exuberant spirits would not indefinitely
respond to my madly driven energy.</p>

<p>But I could not then call a halt. My star was
waxing. I must go on. I would pay the penalty
later&mdash;and I did!</p>

<p>My Paris début was effected under difficulties.
The steamer was delayed; my trunks went astray;
and, to add to my distress, three polite gentlemen
took the trouble to meet me at Cherbourg, to tell
me I had a day to arrive in, one day to rehearse, and
the third day in which to persuade "La Ville Lumière"
of my artistic worth. But the occasion was<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a>
like a whip to a race-horse. It never occurred to
me to refuse, despite my consternation.</p>

<p>Fortunately that shrewd dressmaker of mine,
with admirable foresight (and second-sight as well,
perhaps!) had "completed a whole 'Juliet' outfit
for immediate use&mdash;don't worry," read the telegram.
I could have hugged her!</p>

<p>I hummed a few scales on the dock, and, with a
sigh of relief that all was in order (for I had constant
nightmares that I should lose my voice some day
unexpectedly), I clambered into the overcrowded
express and slumbered peacefully till our early
morning arrival. That day I went gayly to the rehearsal,
and the following evening (not without
much nervous anguish) was greeted with the greatest
enthusiasm by a representative audience.</p>

<p>An interested listener was Gounod's son, who
afterward paid me such delicate and charming compliments
as made my ears burn.</p>

<p>I had become a Parisian personage, and I allowed
myself to enjoy childishly the adulation and
pretty attentions that were showered on me. My
woman's vanity was pleased enough at the lovely
chiffons and bonnets these ingenious people of the
rue de la Paix evolved for my special pleasure.
What with fashionable soirées at which I was<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a>
petted and spoiled, and the parties and teas where
my presence seemed to evoke whispers of admiration
and envy, I might well have had my youthful
head turned to a dizzy angle.</p>

<p>But I had my New England "thinking-cap"
firmly set on my shoulders. A little of this charming
frivolity was enough, and one fine day I disappeared&mdash;back
to the simple life of study and quiet
with the great Lehmann; I shed the iridescence of
my butterfly wings and became, for the nonce, a
hard-working grub!</p>

<p>My stay in Paris was memorable to me as well by
reason of the meeting with Sarah Bernhardt.</p>

<p>My admiration for this wonderful woman had
ever been of the most fervent heroine worship, and
when Madame Grau said: "Sarah wants to know
you; when will you lunch with her?" I set the following
day, for fear she might change her mind and
I might thereby lose this privilege.</p>

<p>I see her still, standing slim and white in her long
curling draperies at the entrance to her home, her
keen eyes appraising me, her voice raised in cordial
greeting. How we chattered! What things she had
to say, and with what joy I listened!</p>

<p>She knew all about "Juliet"&mdash;much to my surprise&mdash;even
to details, such as dress, innovations<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a>
in <i>mise-en-scène</i>, and how I tried to infuse the modern
dramatic spirit into the measures of the opera.
Then the conversation wandered to personalities;
among the most cherished, our mutual great-hearted
friend Coquelin, now, alas! gone to his last
sleep these many years; books, and her obstreperous
dogs, most conspicuous by their noisy presence.
I was to enjoy her friendship from that day on.
As I write, a recent photograph stands before me,
bearing a tender inscription. A smile plays upon
her face, despite her recent tragic affliction. She is
in truth an element, ageless, fearless, dauntless!</p>

<p>It was good to be back for a short season in the
autumn in Berlin, previous to my second departure
for New York. The demonstration of the loyal
Berliners at my return was beautiful, despite successes
elsewhere. I was always to them "<i>unsere

<h4>MISUNDERSTANDINGS</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">M</span><span class="smcap">y</span> second Metropolitan season opened pleasantly
with a neat little success in the comparatively
small rôle of Marguerite in "Mefistofele," which
was produced for the benefit of Chaliapine, the
great Russian basso. Unfortunately, owing to his
dissatisfaction and disappointment at musical matters
in general, nothing would induce him to return
to America, and we thereby lost an artist unique
in all he attempted and unparalleled in some of his
typical Russian creations, such as "Boris" and
"Ivan the Terrible."</p>

<p>January, 1908, saw me on my native heath in
Boston. I sang four performances in six days&mdash;"Faust,"
"Madame Butterfly," "Elizabeth,"
"Pagliacci"&mdash;and the reception was a tornado of
enthusiasm, to which the historic walls of the old
Boston Theater resounded. The conservative Hub
did not deserve such an appellation in the case of
my welcome. I was filled with pride and gratitude.</p>

<p>My own home town also wanted to share in the
festivities; whereupon a concert was arranged, and<a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a>
I returned to sing in the brick town hall that had
first sheltered my early efforts. At the close of the
programme I shook hands with every man, woman,
and child who desired a close scrutiny and personal
greeting&mdash;and you may be sure I was not allowed
to abandon my place on the stage till all had availed
themselves of this invitation.</p>

<p>The following morning the Mayor and several
prominent townspeople called for me, and we visited
the pupils of my former schools. They were
all ready, in line, to greet me, flags in their hands.</p>

<p>When an address was suggested, I arose with
alacrity&mdash;and introduced my friend Kate Douglas
Wiggin, as speaker. Despite her surprise she
rose gracefully to the occasion in a most flattering
little speech, to the delight of her youthful hearers.
I was, indeed, most fortunate to have had a Mistress
of Ceremonies of such tact and charm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Conried's failing health was
necessitating a change of management at the
Metropolitan, and the choice fell upon Mr. Gatti-Casazza,
of La Scala, Milan, in conjunction with
Andreas Dippel, the latter a member of our company
and very popular with New York audiences.
With contracts for Berlin, Paris, and New York,
the old cry of "overwork" was dinned into my<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>
ears, but less than ever was the moment for immediate
rest possible. I was about to make a new
contract with the Metropolitan under a different
management, new artists were engaged who might
reasonably be supposed to share some of the repertoire
which I had not yet sung.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 550px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;AS PRETTY A FLOCK OF BIRDS AS ONE COULD FIND ON ANY FARM&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>It behooved me to keep well within the public eye
and to make my position as advantageous as I
could under the new régime.</p>

<p>Not having acquaintance with Mr. Gatti-Casazza,
I preferred signing my engagement with Mr.
Dippel; but all our arguments came to naught
when he found I was firm in my proposals to improve
upon the old contract, and I sailed away in May
with no more definite answer than "<i>Au revoir</i>
in Paris" to him.</p>

<p>While singing there at the Opéra Comique, we
again went over the same ground&mdash;futilely; and
it was not till the following July in Berlin that I
was able to arrange a several years' engagement
which, in the light of the last years, I may reasonably
conclude has been to nobody's dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>My third Metropolitan season started unhappily.
I arrived ill and fagged; lamentable altercations
took place between the new conductor, Mr. Toscanini,
and myself, each having quite opposite ideas<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>
as to the merits of conductor and prima donna,
respectively. The estrangement was complete after
the opening performance of "Madame Butterfly,"
when we both lost our manners and our tempers
in high-handed fashion.</p>

<p>Outside influences fanned resentment to a white
heat, at least on my part; I was in a fury. The
papers gave space to stupid fabrications and stories
purporting to emanate from those speaking with
authority, whose names, however, one could never
discover.</p>

<p>Ill in mind and health, I was vexed enough to
offer to buy my release from such bondage as I now
lived in artistically. I was far from happy, and when
I am not happy I cannot sing well. My one idea
was to escape from all this turbulence and what
seemed to me to be a hotbed of intrigue. I was a
rebel, yes; but I was no dissembler, and I hated to
come into contact with those in authority under
present conditions. Every performance was an
occasion of dread; things looked very dark for my
peace of mind.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 396px;">
<a href="images/ill_195_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_195_sml.jpg" width="396" height="550" alt="THE GOOSE GIRL IN &quot;KÖNIGSKINDER&quot;" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">THE GOOSE GIRL IN &quot;KÖNIGSKINDER&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Needless to say, I was not granted a release, but
must struggle on during the closing weeks of the
spring. I resigned myself to finish the season as
best I could, but I was quite decided that when<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>
the roll call came the following autumn I would
spend my winter quietly in Berlin. That was all
to be changed, however, by the very unexpected
and friendly overtures which Mr. Toscanini, to my
great surprise, made one memorable evening of
"Madame Butterfly" in Chicago.</p>

<p>When two ardent and honest workers are desirous
of eliminating misunderstandings it is not
difficult to arrive at a solution. The various phases
of the seething disquiet that had prevailed between
us were discussed with commendable frankness
on both sides. I need not add that the result was a
happy one, and I thereby gained a firm friend and
an invaluable ally in my work.</p>

<p>We sealed our differences in a joint curtain call,
that same evening, before a jammed house that was
fully aware of the significance of our unusual appearance
together, and gave way to tumultuous
and approving applause.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to estimate justly the influence
Mr. Toscanini has had in the musical development
of our opera, the artistic direction of which
he rightly controls. Personally I am, as in the
case of Lilli Lehmann, far more indebted to him
than I can properly place in words, certainly
more than he, with a morbid dislike for any public<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>
attention to himself, would perhaps allow me to
admit.</p>

<p>Lehmann&mdash;Bernhardt&mdash;Toscanini! These are
names to conjure with in the career of a young
artist!</p>

<p class="top5">Events in the operatic aviary were now destined
to proceed more or less smoothly for me&mdash;for a
while at least. In the spring of 1909 I was urged to
give some special performances of "La Tosca" at
the Opéra Comique in Paris, with Antonio Scotti
in his admirable characterization of Scarpia. The
success of the opera was most gratifying, and was
in no wise overshadowed by the presence of the
Metropolitan Company, which had come from the
United States to sing in Paris at the same time.</p>

<p>That same spring, before sailing, Toscanini had
asked me to sing Puccini's "Manon" with the
Metropolitan Company during its Paris season.
But the rôle was unfamiliar to me, and as I had
monopolized the more popular Massenet's "Manon,"
I felt I could not undertake its preparation
in six days of ocean travel, together with my promised
performances of Tosca at another theater.
Toscanini quite understood this, made no further
insistence, and the charming Lucretia Bori was<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>
introduced to the Parisian public and later came to
delight her New York admirers.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 410px;">
<a href="images/ill_199_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_199_sml.jpg" width="410" height="550" alt="Photo of Kate Douglas Wiggin" title="Photo of Kate Douglas Wiggin" /></a>
</div>

<p>What transpired to offend Puccini I never knew,
but the trivial question of my not singing his
"Manon" provoked our first argument relative
to "The Girl of the Golden West." The production
of this long-awaited opera from the popular composer
was the one topic of discussion and speculation
in musical circles, its <i>première</i> being scheduled
for the following autumn in New York.</p>

<p>While I had never had the promise of the rôle, the
very subject and its appeal to the American public
would seem to have indicated the choice of a native
prima donna. Not only I, but a large majority of
an interested public expected it. However, Puccini
himself dispelled any such illusion by opening
an argument, while I was singing in a drawing-room,
to the effect that I had refused to sing his
"Manon" because I had not been asked to create
"The Girl." This was really a little too much, and
I retorted that such was not the case, but that it
might be well for him to consider the eventual popularity
of his work with an American singer as the
heroine, and that I was not aware he had changed
his usual suave style of composition to such an
extent that the most popular "Madame Butterfly"<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a>
could not cope with its difficulties. With this I
sailed out of the room.</p>

<p>Possibly the crowded aspect of the house at some
performances at which I sang the following autumn,
and which he attended, modified his opinion,
for he was effusive in compliments and photographs,
and the slight cloud blew over without
further parley.</p>

<p>Afterward I was to be consoled by as gratifying
a success as my heart could wish as the "Goose
Girl." December 28, 1910, saw the <i>première</i> of
the charming "Königskinder," which enchanted the
audience by reason of its lovely simplicity and the
introduction of live geese&mdash;no less!</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 409px;">
<a href="images/ill_203_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_203_sml.jpg" width="409" height="550" alt="MISS FARRAR AND CARUSO IN &quot;JULIAN&quot;" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">MISS FARRAR AND CARUSO IN &quot;JULIAN&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Professor Humperdinck was not a little taken
aback when I first mentioned that I intended having
these live geese which were, according to my
plan, to move naturally and unconfined about the
stage. Mr. Hertz, the conductor, was much perturbed
and objected to the noise and confusion
they might create; but Mr. Gatti was resigned to
my whim and gave assent. So with the help of our
technical director and the "boys" behind the stage
I had as pretty a flock of birds as one could find on
any farm. When the curtain rose upon that idyllic
forest scene, with the goose girl in the grass, the<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a>
geese unconcernedly picking their way about, now
and again spreading snowy wings, unafraid, the
house was simply delighted and applauded long and
vigorously. Not to be overlooked was the sympathetic
appeal of the children's beloved Fiddler, in
the person of Goritz. This operatic fairy-tale held
an enviable place in the regular repertoire for three
years, and was one of my happiest successes.</p>

<p>Following this I was to create a work of a type
quite different from any other I had ever essayed.
Had it not been for Toscanini's urging I should
hardly have chosen "Ariane et Barbe Bleue" as a
medium for my ambitions. While the production
was highly interesting, I cannot say that I am
much in sympathy with the vague outlines of the
modern French lyric heroines; "Mélisande" and
"Ariane" I think can be better entrusted to artists
of a less positive type.<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h4>THE DAYS I NOW ENJOY</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="letter">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> season of 1913-14 came very near proving disastrous
for me. After repeated danger signals, at
last overtaxed Nature took her revenge. I was unable
to cope successfully with a bad attack of bronchitis,
which made me lose the opening night. Some
days afterward, still ill, I was obstinate enough to
insist on a "Madame Butterfly" performance, and
I collapsed completely in a "Faust" performance
later that same week.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my state of mind. Despair
overcame me. The awful nightmare had come to
pass. I should probably never sing again! Then
there flashed through my mind: How should I
endure this enforced inactivity? Daily, hourly, I
waited, and watched, and coaxed a betterment of
my physical condition, which, after all, was at the
bottom of my minor vocal troubles. Outside, a
generous and affectionate public had not forgotten
me, while Mr. Gatti was most kind and patient
with this fretful songbird.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 429px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;CARMEN&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>One day I judged myself at last ready to venture
a performance. Upon my appearance I was greeted
with such welcoming applause as threatened to interfere
with my continuance of the opera. My heart
was full of gratitude as I bowed and bowed my
thanks. By dint of care and caution I was able to
finish the season with credit, even taking the fatiguing
trip to Atlanta, Georgia, prior to sailing, in
order not to disappoint that loyal and enthusiastic
public. That year, too, was the American <i>première</i>
of the long-awaited sequel to "Louise"&mdash;"Julian,"
a hodge-podge of operatic efforts that brought little
satisfaction to anybody concerned in it. To my
surprise the repellent characterization of the gutter-girl
in its last act moved some critical craniums to
speculate favorably on the ultimate success of
"Carmen," should I ever attempt this rôle.</p>

<p>My summer was a long one of quiet and absolute
rest. When I was ready to sail home Europe was
beginning to seethe in her terrible conflict. I raced
from Munich to Amsterdam to get an available
neutral steamer; but the prevailing confusion and
panic occasioned by the fall of Antwerp and mine
disasters in the northern waters made it advisable
for me to follow Mr. Gatti's insistent message to
join him and the company immediately at Naples.</p>

<p>Ah, that journey to the end of Italy! Shall I ever<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a>
forget it? Fortunately, Mr. Gatti had been able to
assemble all his songsters&mdash;with the exception of
Gilly, our French barytone, a prisoner of war in
Austria&mdash;and we were to enjoy an agreeable and
uneventful ocean trip home.</p>

<p>It was while on shipboard, discussing the repertoire,
that Toscanini suggested the immediate
preparation of "Carmen" for my first appearance
of the season. I jumped at the idea, the more so
since I should have a rôle I had always longed to
sing and which favored me as I had rarely been
favored. Here was indeed an occasion to refute
many an unkind rumor that I had lost my voice
and would never sing again. And as for the acting,
and looking&mdash;well, I smiled into the miserable
little glass in my stateroom that did duty as a
mirror, and blew myself a kiss of congratulation!
Daily rehearsals were called, and I worked like a
slave in the little stuffy dining-room of the ship to
the accompaniment of a piano no better than it
should be.</p>

<p>Many a gypsy had come and gone, leaving New
York mildly indifferent. There had been but one
fascinating, unforgettable creature within our
memory, the incomparable Calvé! Not one leaf
of her coronet of laurel had so much as quivered!</p>

<span class="caption">WORK AND PLAY IN CALIFORNIA</span>
</div>

<p><a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>The eventful evening came at last, and I need not
dwell upon the wonderful success that attended
the brilliant revival of this well-loved opera under
Toscanini's splendid direction.</p>

<p>Later in the same season was to come the amusing
"Madame Sans Gêne," chiefly interesting for
its novelty and touches of comedy.</p>

<p>Added to the fortunate operatic successes, I had
made several concert <i>tournées</i>, my contract with the
record-makers had been rigidly kept, and to succeed
in all these artistic directions, the well-being
of the voice had ever primarily to be considered.</p>

<p>When the fateful time came that I paid the toll
of overwork and my throat was temporarily crippled,
my mind was doubly alive and in acute anguish.
Inactivity to me has always been something
not to be borne. I must have a vital interest with
which to stimulate my energies and fancies.</p>

<p>It was during those discouraging days that I bethought
me of the very ardent advances that had
been made to me relative to the moving pictures.
Perhaps there was another field of expression, not
to mention the very flattering financial considerations
that were to accompany the offer, did I allow
myself to be persuaded.</p>

<p>No small amount of half-hearted condemnation<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>
and significant shoulder shrugging accompanied
the announcement that I might seriously consider
such a proposal.</p>

<p>"Oh, Geraldine! How can you?" I heard on
every hand.</p>

<p>But why shouldn't I? I have never been the
overcautious prima donna, swathed in cotton, silent,
save for singing, for fear of undue fatigue upon
the voice&mdash;the human vocalizer! No. I like the
novel and the unusual always, and I <i>adore</i> to act!</p>

<p>My friendship with the family of David Belasco,
and his son-in-law, Mr. Gest, having large interests
in the moving pictures, led me finally to accede to
their request; and I signed a contract which promised
to be (and fulfilled happily!) as successful a
venture as any I have ever undertaken.</p>

<p>My arrival in Los Angeles, the beautifully appointed
house there, the special studio built for my
privacy and convenience are of too recent an interest
to reiterate here. The experience itself was
novel and refreshing, with its own unusual dramatic
procedure. I sang and declaimed my rôle in French
or Italian as I chose. There was no curtain to go up!
The director-general replaced the harassed stage
manager and gave the signal: "Camera! Go!" No
fiery leader overwhelmed me with the feverish
tempest of his orchestra; just a watchful operator
warily turning the crank of his machine while I
evolved my "scenes" as I wished.</p>

<p><a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a>My "Carmen" has made her screen début, and
many of you have doubtless seen it. I have been
delighted at its success, and feel that its artistic
excellence and the enthusiastic approbation it has
met speak loudly enough in favor of my departure
from the usual routine of the prima donna.</p>

<p>I have been asked, in summing up these experiences
of my artistic career, so far, if it has all been
worth while? From my point of view, yes. That is,
what you believe to be the most complete fulfillment
of yourself and the gratification of your ambitions
is always worth while. Fortunately for me
the adventurous and inquiring turn of my mind
does not allow my ambitions to become narrowed
or stationary, and that may possibly account for
the unusual phases in my musical career.</p>

<p>It is, however, distinctly <i>not</i> worth while, to my
mind, unless Fortune smiles upon you in abundance,
for art is not the medium stratum of life, but its
flowered inspiration and emotional poetry: it demands
and obtains its sacrifices and sorrows which
modify and chasten its glory, and your own soul
best knows the toll you pay.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a></p>

<p>Personally I would not encourage the graduate
of the church choir, or the youthful miss with the
pretty voice and smug mind, to embark upon a
grand-opera career, such as I have come to understand
it. By that, I mean the exceptional career
that demands the big outlook and risk in all one
attempts&mdash;the sacrifices, the unceasing toil, an
iron constitution, invulnerable nerves, to say nothing
of the financial security involved, according
to the magnitude of the undertaking. With the
many who earn a comfortable livelihood by their
agreeable song I have no question, being, as I said
before, solely concerned with the exceptional gift
that will not be denied, that brushes aside all obstacles,
to proceed on the path of wide appeal in any
branch of art or occupation.</p>

<p>When intelligent people will begin to open their
minds and refuse to be cajoled by flattery and hypocrisy
as to what constitutes "an artistic career,"
it may be better for American art in general and
easier for the girl who cherishes high ambitions.</p>

<p>How many aimless letters fill the musical columns
with admirable advice on a profession of
which the writers betray their naïve ignorance by
the general vacuity of their remarks, when presuming
to measure an artist's impulses and inspirations<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>
by their own personal standards and emotions!
Let the artist develop in his own orbit, according to
his light, nor criticize the method of the fruition
of those gifts he so generously flings to his hearers.</p>

I may enjoy for many years to come: the discerning,
generous and appreciative American public!</p>
